Isolation, characterization and applications of marine derived compounds show a promising way to develop novel drugs to treat various diseases. Phlorotannins are one of the main compounds which are commonly isolated from the brown seaweeds. The structural unit of phlorotannins is made-up of polyphenolic units. Due to the unique structures, phlorotannins show a variety of biological activities such as antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antitumor, antidiabetics, radio protective, antiadipogenic, and anti-allergic effects. In the current chapter, we have discussed general information on phlorotannins, extraction procedure and their biological activities in detail. From the scientific literature, phlorotannins can be potentially useful in the development of pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals.","fda68ec4aff7804e5fc03db339dab5dec41588aa","True","Encyclopedia of Food Chemistry","one","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-08-100596-5.22360-3","custom_license"
"Yun, Qidong","Chapter 8 Politics, Profit and Digital Prospect Guangdong Provincial Publishing Group as a Case","Abstract A case study of the Guangdong Provincial Publishing Group has revealed that Chinese publishing groups are still firmly controlled by the party-state. Although regional governments could protect their economic interests in local publishing industry, political control from the central party-state is firmly installed. The propaganda role of the publishing industry may have declined after the onset of economic reforms, but the ability of the party-state to maintain its political control has not been weakened, and may have even been strengthened. In spite of the corporatization, China’s publishing houses were never intended to be pure business entities, and many continue to rely on monopolistic profits or government subsidies for their financial viability. The digital transformation in publishers is heavily shaped and constrained by the institutional problems of the publishing industry.","9ca342485e40da93005c6cb173d6be104fb0eb64","True","China's Publishing Industry","the Guangdong Provincial Publishing Group|Chinese|China","els-covid","","","","ORG|NORP|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-08-100919-2.00008-5","custom_license"

Medical waste generation and disposal is an important aspect, especially in countries with poor hygiene and high population. Medical centers including hospitals, clinics, and places where diagnosis and treatment are conducted generate wastes that are highly hazardous and put people under risk of fatal diseases. Policies should be framed to avoid spread of infections by providing specification for handling waste for generation, segregation, collection, storage, transportation, and treatment. Awareness should be created at all levels of society through various means of communication and education, so that the risks of spreading the health hazards could be minimized.

"Gui, Weijun; Paudel, Prajwal; Zhuang, Zhihao","Activity-Based Ubiquitin Probes for Investigation of Deubiquitinases","Abstract Ubiquitination is emerging as an important post-translational modification (PTM) for numerous cellular functions including protein degradation, DNA damage repair and tolerance, and cell cycle progression. Compared with other small-molecule modifiers found in phosphorylation, acetylation and glycosylation, ubiquitin is a small protein modifier that exists as either a single ubiquitin or a polyubiquitin chain. Furthermore, the polyubiquitin chains are formed via various linkages imparting an additional layer of specificity in cellular signaling. In order to adequately study ubiquitin signaling and particularly deubiquitination, a number of ubiquitin activity-based probes (ABPs) were developed and utilized in understanding the deubiquitinase (DUBs) function. Here, we focus on the current state of the DUB ABP development and their application in understanding DUB function and specificity for polyubiquitin chains and ubiquitinated proteins.","129ca9620487d597268964c705884f95d39861c8","True","Reference Module in Chemistry, Molecular Sciences and Chemical Engineering","DUB|DUB","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-409547-2.14672-4","custom_license"
"Butler, Colin D.; Higgs, Kerryn; McFarlane, Rosemary Anne","Environmental Health, Planetary Boundaries and Limits to Growth","Abstract Published almost 50years ago, the Limits to Growth remains relevant to contemporary environmental health, though, paradoxically, this relevance is scarcely recognized. The seminal ideas it presented provide a useful background, as do the later Planetary Boundaries analyses, with which to consider key issues in contemporary environmental health. To be more than reactive, it is necessary to understand the complexity and interactions of integrated environmental health risks, including the possibility of significant global population decline within the current century. This contribution provides an overview to the Limits to Growth, linking it especially to the “planetary boundaries” of climate change, biodiversity loss and novel entities (including artificial substances and genetically modified organisms). The gradual increase in the amount of primary energy required to generate useable energy is also argued to be an under-recognized contributing factor to the decline in real wages growth for much of the world’s population since then, although this aspect may be improving. These elements have positive and negative health effects, which we discuss.","336a882d9b844a8fb15a58a0e976e5ee236b1647","True","Encyclopedia of Environmental Health","the current century|the Limits to Growth","els-covid","","","","DATE|EVENT","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-409548-9.10651-7","custom_license"
"Radosavljevic, Vladan","Environmental Health and Bioterrorism☆","Abstract Environment has complex and permanent relations with the biological warfare in comparison to other war types (conventional, nuclear, chemical). Changes of the environment interfere with many of the major determinants of biological warfare. The most probable type and the key issue of biological war is bioterrorism. Bioterrorism is defined as a release of biological agents or toxins that affect human beings, animals, or plants with the intent to harm or intimidate. The essence of bioterrorism is a biological attack. Four components are required for a biological attack: perpetrators, agents, mediums/means of delivery, and targets.","9df16bee325f27a60ed786cb84b4f078d5647e73","True","Encyclopedia of Environmental Health","Four","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-409548-9.11435-6","custom_license"
"Neill, P.E.; Arim, M.","Human Health Link to Invasive Species☆","Abstract Invasive species are currently a far-reaching, interdisciplinary topic given their broad impacts on biodiversity, economics, and human health, with representatives from all taxonomic levels (e.g., viruses, bacteria, algae, plants, invertebrates, large mammals). Researchers from different fields are working to build a framework for understanding how to best evaluate, quantify, and predict different kinds of impacts by non-indigenous species (NIS). In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e., initial establishment, expansion, and saturation). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in new environments. In the scenario of global change, species introductions and invasions are a major topic due to ecological impacts (e.g., changes in biodiversity), economic and social impacts (e.g., costs incurred for control or eradication or pests) and human health impacts (e.g., epidemics or increased exposure to hazards). Current research highlights the introduction and spread of non-indigenous species as both a consequence and cause of global change with repercussions on ecosystems, economies, and human societies.","b4ade483fc940506ea660bbcd63597d5f143e099","True","Encyclopedia of Environmental Health","Abstract Invasive|NIS","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-409548-9.11731-2","custom_license"

Metallic bismuth and bismuth compounds have been widely used in the manufacture of alloys, pigments, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. As a “green” heavy metal, the substitution of lead with bismuth in some industries may partially resolve the environmental problems related to heavy metal pollution. In health care, as bismuth has low toxicity to humans, bismuth-based drugs such as colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC), bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), bismuth iodoform and radioactive bismuth (212Bi/213Bi) complexes have been developed and used in clinics to treat various diseases.

"Paintsil, E.; Cheng, Y.-C.","Antiviral Agents☆","Abstract Antiviral agents are drugs approved in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment or control of viral infections. Available antiviral agents mainly target stages in the viral life cycle. The target stages in the viral life cycle are; viral attachment to host cell, uncoating, synthesis of viral mRNA, translation of mRNA, replication of viral RNA and DNA, maturation of new viral proteins, budding, release of newly synthesized virus, and free virus in body fluids. Two important factors that can limit the utility of antiviral drugs are toxicity and the development of resistance to the antiviral agent by the virus. In addition, host phenotypic behaviors toward antiviral drugs because of either genomic or epigenetic factors could limit the efficacy of an antiviral agent in an individual. This article summarizes the most relevant pharmacologic and clinical properties of current antiviral agents, and targets for novel antiviral agents.","a14179b2fb219e7aeb002b678593cf2b3cb76662","True","Encyclopedia of Microbiology","USA|the Food and Drug Administration|FDA|RNA|Two","els-covid","","","","GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-801238-3.02387-4","custom_license"

However, the proposal of VAP rates as a quality indicator has generated debate due a lack of a gold standard definition. In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) replaced surveillance definitions from VAP to other preventable conditions related to mechanical ventilation (ventilator-associated events: VAE), which may predict outcomes. This represents a new opportunity to overcome many of the weaknesses of traditional VAP surveillance and broadens the focus of surveillance encompassing other preventable conditions related to mechanical ventilation.","2e3213c7bbf8226230e73de34cda1f0c1a491d9e","True","Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences","VAP|VAP|2013|the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC|VAP|VAE|VAP","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-801238-3.11482-5","custom_license"
"Alenazi, Thamer H.; Arabi, Yaseen M.","Severe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Pneumonia","Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection, which ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, caused by a novel coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Majority of cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia. MERS cases occur as sporadic cases or as clusters or hospital outbreaks. Dromedary camels are thought to be a host for MERS-CoV. Direct contact with dromedary camels within 14days prior to infection was identified as an independent risk factor for MERS. Diagnosis of MERS is based on a positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), obtained from a respiratory specimen. The mainstay of management of MERS-CoV infection is supportive care. There is no specific antiviral therapy for MERS-CoV infection at present, although several modalities of treatment options have been examined or are under investigation.","812323f9e0b58ce57f13ecd34459eef3e32ca025","True","Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus|Saudi Arabia|14days|Diagnosis|CoV|CoV","els-covid","","","","ORG|GPE|DATE|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-801238-3.11488-6","custom_license"
"Yates, Marylynn V.","Drinking Water Microbiology","Abstract Every year, on a global basis, billions of cases of illness result from ingestion of microorganisms in drinking water. The majority of these illnesses are caused by fecal contamination, resulting in diarrhea. In places where access to medical care is not readily available, diarrhea can lead to death from dehydration; unfortunately, 1.5 million people, many of whom are children, die annually as a result. There are hundreds of pathogens that may be present in fecal material, making it not feasible to analyze water for all of them. Thus, the microbiological quality of water is monitored using indicator organisms, such as coliform bacteria, enterococci, and/or bacteriophages, which are much simpler and less expensive to detect. The use of indicators, while not perfect, has resulted in a decrease in the incidence of waterborne disease.","7abfa9a78e233f70972c95e0b25a41c4d46d1785","True","Encyclopedia of Microbiology","Every year|billions|1.5 million|annually|hundreds","els-covid","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-801238-3.66123-8","custom_license"

"Fischer, Robert J.; Halibozek, Edward P.; Walters, David C.","11 Contingency Planning Emergency Response and Safety","Abstract Although there is some recognition of the importance of contingency planning, far too few firms have anything beyond a contingency plan that sits on a shelf in the CEO’s office. Even in those companies with crisis management teams (CMTs), the members often do not meet to plan or even discuss how the team would function in an actual situation. The most progressive firms offer the team members, fire brigades, and employees an opportunity to preplan (contingency planning) through mock exercises that replicate industrial disasters, explosions, fires, or tornado alerts. The end result is a better-prepared team of employees ready to respond to any contingency. Unfortunately, many firms have not gone this far. Contingency planning may not have been a traditional security process, but in today’s global business environment the security organization is assuming a much greater role and responsibility for its implementation. Even prior to the events of September 11, 2001, many organizations were becoming more conscious of the need to have contingency plans. A complete contingency planning program has three major elements: 1. Emergency Response 2. Crisis Management 3. Business Continuity: Business Recovery and Business Resumption Emergency response activities involve responding to an incident, crisis or disaster and managing that incident at the scene. Should an incident escalate to the crisis or disaster stage, a CMT should take over managing the crisis to its conclusion. If the crisis or disaster does cause damage to a company building, facility or operation, the CMT should hand over to a business continuity team the responsibility of recovery and resumption. After a disaster, it is critical that the business recovers and resumes normal (pre-event) operations as soon as possible. Customers, shareholders and stakeholders expect nothing less. Executive management has the obligation to ensure contingency planning is properly considered and addressed within their company. The consequences of not planning for contingencies can be catastrophic with numerous liability issues.","5e711305435f5ce3508c3cc9b4bba6ef4f0b2d9a","True","Introduction to Security","today|September 11, 2001|three|1|2|3|Business Continuity: Business Recovery and Business Resumption|CMT|CMT","els-covid","","","","DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-805310-2.00011-1","custom_license"
"Gonzalez-Martin, Cristina","Airborne Infectious Microorganisms☆","Abstract Inhalation exposes the upper and lower respiratory tracts of humans to a variety of airborne particles and vapors. Airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to humans from the environment, animals, or other humans can result in disease. Inhalation is an important route of exposure as the lung is more susceptible to infection than the gastrointestinal tract. Ingested microorganisms must pass through the acidic environment of the stomach before they can colonize tissue while inhaled microorganisms are deposited directly on the moist surfaces of the respiratory tract. Inhalation of microbial aerosols can elicit adverse human health effects including infection, allergic reaction, inflammation, and respiratory disease. Following inhalation, infectious viruses, bacteria, and fungi can establish in host cells of the respiratory tract. Some are translocated and infect the gastrointestinal tract and other tissues. This article discusses human viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases transmitted via aerosols. Viral diseases presented are influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), enteric viruses related infections, hantavirus disease, measles, and varicella. Bacterial diseases are Legionnaires’ disease, tuberculosis, and nontubercule mycobacterial disease. Exposure to some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, endotoxin, and actinomycetes when dispersed through the air can result in disease following inhalation. Fungal diseases included are histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, and aspergillosis.

A close association between migration and hibernation exists in temperate, but not in tropical, bats. Compared with birds, bats are relatively short-distance migrators, with maximum migration distances being <2000 km; intercontinental migration is likely to be uncommon in bats. Migratory bats have lower levels of population subdivision and larger genetically effective population sizes than nonmigratory bats. A variety of methods, including banding, genetic analyses, stable isotope analyses, and tracking with radio or satellite transmitters, are currently being used to study bat migration. The conservation of migratory bats poses special challenges that require national and international efforts. Migratory bats sometimes harbor pathogens that can be transmitted to humans. Overall, the beneficial aspects of migratory bats, including control of insect populations and dispersal of pollen and seeds over broad areas, far outweigh their negative aspects.","33ea9c98c7d8c301024203604335c77ebae7b606","True","Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior","2000","els-covid","","","","DATE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-809633-8.20764-4","custom_license"

"Bowen, John","Chapter 8 Lions and Tigers: LCCs in Southeast Asia","Abstract Southeast Asia is home to one of the largest budget airline sectors, with low-cost carriers (LCCs) accounting for nearly half of seat capacity on scheduled flights in 2018. The most prolific no-frills carrier in the region is Malaysia-based AirAsia, which has affiliates in Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and beyond. Similarly, Indonesia's Lion Air has formed a family of related carriers across much of the region. These and other LCCs have prospered partly through their political connections, illustrating that even in a liberalized region the power of the state to shape the industry remains formidable. A challenge for the industry is the lack of secondary airports and of strained capacity at the region's principal hubs; pilots and other skilled industry personnel are in short supply too. Nevertheless, the development of long-haul budget airlines, including Singapore Airlines’ subsidiary Scoot and several long-haul affiliates of AirAsia signals the maturity of the LCC sector.","9afcb07e2677a9e42e0fe8302e23fe588a4fb6d0","True","Low-Cost Carriers in Emerging Countries","Southeast Asia|nearly half|2018|Malaysia|AirAsia|Thailand|Indonesia|Philippines|Indonesia|Lion Air|Singapore|Scoot|AirAsia|LCC","els-covid","","","","LOC|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-811393-6.00008-3","custom_license"

"Mansfield, Keith G.; Fox, James G.","Chapter 16 Bacterial Diseases","Abstract Common marmosets are susceptible to a number of bacterial infections, which may be enzootic, causing sporadic but occasionally severe disease, or which may result in epizootics associated with more severe colony morbidity and mortality. The spectrum of these diseases often differs from those observed in macaque species, and veterinarians caring for common marmosets need to be aware of these unique susceptibilities. In formulating differential diagnoses for sick or diseased animals, it should be recognized that diseases once common in imported animals in the 1960s and 1970s are now rare. It is also important to recognize that housing and sanitation conditions can influence exposure to potentially pathogenic bacteria. In a zoological setting where mixed- or free-ranging exhibits are utilized, animals may be exposed to many more potential pathogens than would be the case in animals raised in a barrier facility.","420d950e49c28d2a2ce7f0795f578c18f12e1d67","True","The Common Marmoset in Captivity and Biomedical Research","1960s|1970s","els-covid","","","","DATE|DATE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-811829-0.00016-9","custom_license"

These animals are native to the Atlantic coastal forests in northeastern Brazil. The majority of experimental animals come from the National Primate Research Centers and other breeding facilities. They are advantageous because of their relative small size, weighting 350–400g as adults, their life span is compact compared with other nonhuman primate (NHP), and they produce offspring by 3years of age. They are free of Herpes B virus and, it is believed, to date, other dangerous human pathogens (Abbot et al., 2003) [1]. We describe here the experimental infections of marmosets to human pathogens. While it is always interesting to compare various NHPs with each other, the importance of an animal model is always in comparing its similarities to human infections.","6f03d5d43034e160c6a8d5a66be1fce79fd7cb23","True","The Common Marmoset in Captivity and Biomedical Research","the last decade|Atlantic|Brazil|the National Primate Research Centers|350–400|NHP|3years|Herpes B|Abbot|2003|1","els-covid","","","","DATE|LOC|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-811829-0.00028-5","custom_license"
"Soltis, Douglas E.; Soltis, Pamela S.","Chapter 5 The Value of the Tree of Life","Abstract The value of the Tree of Life to human well-being and survival is enormous—our species simply cannot thrive without a biodiverse planet; that is, a healthy Tree of Life. The vast importance of the Tree of Life falls into several general categories. First, the immense overall importance of biodiversity not only involves providing food, medicines, and ecosystem services such as clean air and water, but also a second major theme of this chapter is the importance to human well-being of knowledge of how species are related. Knowledge of how organisms are related has predictive value. We all know from our own family trees that relationships matter. For example, if a close relative has a disease or cancer that is genetically inherited, we realize that there is a chance we may have inherited that trait. Similarly, broad knowledge of relationships is fundamental, providing crucial new information regarding the discovery of medicines, combatting disease, crop improvement, while also providing insight into the study of ecosystem function and services (clean air and water). Knowledge of species relationships and the Tree of Life can help in the discovery of new medicines—closely related organisms produce similar chemicals; similarly, that knowledge of relationships is essential to improve crops by identifying close wild relatives that may have important traits (disease resistance, drought tolerance). Knowledge of the Tree of Life can also aid in the study of ecology and conservation efforts. As closely related species will often respond in similar ways to environmental factors such as temperature and moisture availability, the Tree of Life can also provide critical information in predicting how species may respond to climate change.","1e54b4c6d2a9fb30b0fa2e295d7d16fc521ead5c","True","The Great Tree of Life","the Tree of Life|Tree of Life|the Tree of Life|First|second","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|ORDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-812553-3.00005-9","custom_license"

In parallel, clinical pharmacy and practice research is evolving. Research evidence should be used to identify new areas for improved health service delivery and rigorously evaluate new services in pharmacy. The generation of such evidence through practice-based research should be predicated on appropriate use of robust and rigorous methodologies. In addition to the quantitative and qualitative approaches used in pharmacy practice research, mixed methods and other novel approaches are increasingly being applied in pharmacy practice research. Approaches such as discrete choice experiments, Delphi techniques, and simulated client technique are now commonly used in pharmacy practice research. Therefore, pharmacy practice researchers need to be competent in the selection, application, and interpretation of these methodological and analytical approaches. This chapter focuses on introducing traditional and novel study designs and methodologies that are particularly pertinent to contemporary clinical pharmacy and practice research. This chapter will introduce the fundamentals and structures of these methodologies, but more details regarding the different approaches may be found within the Encyclopedia.","0cd23874388f6556a8c97e153358ce6e274d3a59","True","Encyclopedia of Pharmacy Practice and Clinical Pharmacy","Delphi|Encyclopedia","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-812735-3.00602-6","custom_license"

Maintenance resource management (MRM) or maintenance human factors (MHF) programs started with a unique, three-party research program. The aviation industry (airlines and repair stations), federal agencies (the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)), and the academic community came together to study specific safety issues in the technical operations environment (line and base maintenance facilities, maintenance, repair, and overhaul-MRO-facilities, as well as ramp operations). The FAA and NASA funded this research, university faculty members and students conducted the research activities, and the industry partners provided access to facilities and personnel. At an international level, the FAA and NASA, Transport Canada, and United Kingdom. Civil Aviation Authority participated in another three-way partnership that enabled information sharing among the researchers, regulators, and practitioners. This chapter also reviews some of the most commonly used incident review tools and the associated taxonomies. With the increased use of structured approach to incident investigation, the use of MRM programs moved from simple awareness programs to reactive error-correction programs, and subsequently matured to proactive, error-avoidance programs, paving the way for predictive trend analysis programs. Finally, this chapter reviews the influence of MRM programs on the safety culture in technical operations and identifies some emerging opportunities for continued research and development.","ddd100faa8dd53b1e89abfcb15ab1e318ca4eaab","True","Crew Resource Management","MRM|MRM|Technical Operations|MRM|MHF|three|the Federal Aviation Administration|FAA|the National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA|FAA|NASA|FAA|NASA|Transport Canada|United Kingdom|Civil Aviation Authority|three|MRM|MRM","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-812995-1.00013-0","custom_license"

Only about 30% of the fresh water total is available on earth, in groundwater and surface water, for drinking and other daily human activities as well as industrial and agricultural activities. Further, 20% of the available fresh water is not available to humans living in remote areas, 60% of fresh water cannot be captured, as it comes at inconvenient times and places (e.g., monsoons and floods), and 18% of fresh water is contaminated by human activities. Only about 2% of fresh water is available for usage. Developed countries have advanced technology for water treatment and are thus able to manage the problem of water scarcity to a large extent, but advanced technology is largely unprocurable in developing and undeveloped countries due to cost. Based on the current population growth rate, it has been estimated that over 3.5 billion people will be in a water scarcity condition by 2025. The problem has become exacerbated due to the introduction of various recalcitrant, nondegradable compounds by agricultural and industrial activities. These compounds cannot be removed completely by any current available technologies. Thus, there is an urgent need of easily procurable technology with excellent efficacy in wastewater treatment.","4519a00fc77a763fa8a56915d74387e21641b386","True","Solutions to Environmental Problems Involving Nanotechnology and Enzyme Technology","Only about 30%|daily|20%|60%|18%|Only about 2%|over 3.5 billion|2025","els-covid","","","","PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-813123-7.00003-7","custom_license"

Steviol glucosides include rubusoside (Ru), stevioside (Ste), and rebaudioside (Reb), which have immunomodulatory capability and protective effects against hyperglycemia, hypertension, inflammation, tumors, and diarrhea. In addition, they can enhance the solubility of epotoside, liquiritin, paclitaxel, curcuminoids, quercetin, and wheat bran flavonoids, thus increasing their permeability. The hydrolysis of three glucosyl groups at positions C13 and C19 of Ste will produce steviolbioside, steviol, isosteviol, steviol mono-glucoside, or Ru. S. rebaudiana contains these hydrolyzed products in trace amounts. This chapter describes recent advances in the preparation of various steviol glycosides from Ste by using different β-glycosidases, with particular focus on their potential industrial applications as natural solubilizers of insoluble compounds.

This is likely related to regular acute (and possibly chronic) periods of exercise-induced changes in immune function. URT infections can compromise performance directly if suffered shortly before or during competition or indirectly if suffered at other times via effects on training and/or physiological adaptations.

"Perčulija, Vanja; Ouyang, Songying","Chapter 9 Diverse Roles of DEAD/DEAH-Box Helicases in Innate Immunity and Diseases","Abstract DEAD/DEAH-box helicases are enzymes that belong to the DEAD/H-box family of SF2 helicase superfamily. These enzymes are essential in RNA metabolism, where they are involved in a number of processes that require manipulation of RNA structure. Recent studies have found that some DEAD/DEAH-box helicases play important roles in innate immunity, where they act as sensors of cytosolic DNA/RNA, as adaptor proteins, or as regulators of signaling and gene expression. In spite of their function in immunity, DEAD/DEAH-box helicases can also be hijacked and exploited by viruses to circumvent detection and aid in viral replication. These findings not only imply that DEAD/DEAH-box helicases have a broader function than previously thought, but also give us a much better understanding of immune mechanisms and diseases that arise due to the dysregulation or evasion thereof. In this chapter, we demonstrate the known scope of activities of human DEAD/DEAH-box helicases in innate immunity and interaction with viruses or other pathogens. Additionally, we give an outline of diseases in which they are, or may be, involved in the context of immunity.","46b355f72e611c05ba32943b7e90219dea804cca","True","Helicases from All Domains of Life","DEAD/H|SF2|RNA|RNA|DEAD/DEAH|RNA|DEAD/DEAH|DEAD/DEAH|DEAD/DEAH","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-814685-9.00009-9","custom_license"

In response to variations in the extracellular environment, the collective behavior of cell populations can be coordinated by regulating community-level gene expression. This mechanism is strongly conserved during evolution, being shared both by bacterial communities and central nervous system cells. Notably, cyclic dipeptides (CDPs) are molecules that are implicated in these quorum sensing behaviors in both settings. Bacteria coordinate their collective behavior by producing CDPs (quorum sensing inducers) that enhance the capacity of individual members of the community to detect these signals and thus amplify the community-level response. In this review, we highlight recent data indicating that strikingly similar molecular mechanisms control communications between glial and neuronal cells to maintain homeostasis in the central nervous system, with a specific focus on the role of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone—derived CDP cyclo(His-Pro) in the protection against neurotoxic insults.","fdf3376c91559ca7269a1a31b2e67693d8439f1c","True","Quorum Sensing","Bacteria|CDP","els-covid","","","","GPE|NORP","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-814905-8.00010-1","custom_license"

As advancements in technology occur, more people these days are using social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Due to the increase in social media's popularity, the types of behaviors are now easier to group and study as this is important to know the behavior of users via social networking in order to analyze similarities of certain behavior types and this can be used to predict what they post as well as what they comment, share, and like on social networking sites. However, very few review studies have undertaken grouping according to similarities and differences to predict the personality and behavior of individuals with the help of social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to collect data from previous researches and to analyze the methods they have used. This chapter reviewed 30 research studies on the topic of behavioral analysis using the social media from 2015 to 2017. This research is based on the method of previous publications and analyzed the results, limitations, and number of users to draw conclusions. Our results indicated that the percentage of completed research on the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram show that 50% of the studies were done on Twitter, 27% on Facebook, and 23% on Instagram. Twitter seems to be more popular and recent than the other two spheres as there are more studies on it. Further, we extracted the studies based on the year and graphs in 2015 which indicated that more research has been done on Facebook to analyze the behavior of users and the trends are decreasing in the following year. However, more studies have been done on Twitter in 2016 than any other social media. The results also show the classifications based on different methods to analyze individual behavior. However, most of the studies have been done on Twitter, as it is more popular and newer than Facebook and Instagram particularly from 2015 to 2017, and more research needs to be done on other social media spheres in order to analyze the trending behaviors of users. This study should be useful to obtain knowledge about the methods used to analyze user behavior with description, limitations, and results. Although some researchers collect demographic information on users’ gender on Facebook, others on Twitter do not. This lack of demographic data, which is typically available in more traditional sources such as surveys, has created a new focus on developing methods to work out these traits as a means of expanding Big Data research.","2ec38198b8382246c22ad30fdab26ca53f32ef1c","True","Social Network Analytics","these days|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|30|2015 to 2017|Twitter|Instagram|50%|Twitter|27%|Facebook|23%|Instagram|two spheres|the year|2015|Facebook|the following year|Twitter|2016|Twitter|Facebook|Instagram|2015 to 2017|users’|Facebook|Twitter|Big Data","els-covid","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|QUANTITY|DATE|DATE|ORG|DATE|GPE|DATE|GPE|ORG|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-815458-8.00005-0","custom_license"

"Rorat, Agnieszka; Courtois, Pauline; Vandenbulcke, Franck; Lemiere, Sébastien","8 Sanitary and environmental aspects of sewage sludge management","Abstract Currently, sewage sludge management is a huge challenge in the field of environmental engineering. New effective solutions for the treatment of wastewater led to an improvement of the quality of the final effluent but considerably increased the volume of produced sewage sludge, which increases each year. Two points of view conflict regarding the recycling of those “wastes.” Primarily, dehydrated sewage sludge is considered a reservoir of nutrients and organic matter that can be used as a fertilizer in agriculture or as an organic amendment in the remediation of contaminated sites or to build “anthroposoils.” On the other hand, recycled sewage sludge is seen as a potential source of soil contamination by organic and inorganic pollutants and pathogens; potentially toxic elements (such as zinc, copper, cadmium, lead, silver, etc.); polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH); polychlorobiphenyls (PCB); biocides and phytopharmaceuticals; pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCP), and residuals; synthetic hormones; microplastics; nanotechnology life cycle end products; and microorganisms such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Salmonella typhimurium. This chapter will focus on these aspects, highlighting the health and ecotoxicological risks associated with the presence of such contaminants in sludge. The environmental dangers of sludge spreading on soils will be presented as well as their possible treatment scenarios to propose an acceptable reuse of sewage sludge in a circular economy.","c63950e518474b14b821ac051e48eadd02613ddd","True","Industrial and Municipal Sludge","each year|Two|PAH|PCB|PPCP|Escherichia|Salmonella","els-covid","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-815907-1.00008-8","custom_license"

"Kathera, Chandrasekhar","Chapter 3 Microbial Proteomics and Their Importance in Medical Microbiology","Abstract Microbial infection is a leading cause of death around the world. Most of the infectious diseases are caused by drug-resistant microbes; this may lead to a delay in the administration of microbiologically effective therapy (Chen et al., 2017; Del Chierico et al., 2014). Therefore, exhaustive understanding of microbial physiologies, infection and defense systems, and survival strategies is of great interest in order to actively defeat microbial infection. Microbial proteomics provides complete information of microbial physiology and expression and function of the proteins that are involved in infection and also gives a clue in clinical diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy (Pérez-Llarena and Bou, 2016; Vranakis et al., 2014). Microbial proteomics helps to identify the proteins associated with microbial activity, microbial host-pathogen interactions, and antimicrobial resistant mechanism. Microbial activity of pathogens can be confirmed by using the 2-D gel-based and gel-free method with the combination of MALDI-TOF-LC-MS/MS. Proteomic analysis of microbial host-pathogen interaction reveals valuable information about the virulence of the pathogen and its resistance; it helps in better understanding of the infection and for developing strategies against microbial infections (Cheng et al., 2016).

"Bhagwat, Vinod R.","Chapter 9 Safety of Water Used in Food Production","Abstract Water has a major and fundamental role in safety of food production. It is a critical resource for the food industry with wide uses. In most of the food preparation and processing operations, water is often taken for granted. Water is very commonly used in food production at various levels, apart from being used as an ingredient. Water quality and its impact on food products and various operations in food industries are often underestimated. Such underestimation often leads to mismanagement of water, equipment operation and maintenance issues, loss of revenue, food safety, and product quality. This chapter deals with several aspects of water as applicable to the food production. Agriculture is the largest consumer of water, requiring over 100 times more than that used for personal needs. The concept of water footprint is used to discern the importance of relative value in terms of water. The water footprint of any animal product is larger than the water footprint of a wisely chosen crop product with equivalent nutritional value. The production of meat requires between 6 and 20 times more water than for cereals and vegetables or fruits. Water is indispensible in cleaning and sanitization in food production, which is an integral part in processing operations in food production. In food storage and preservation, water plays a key role. The water activity of food helps a great deal in deciding shelf-life and food safety. The quality of water is the fundamental consideration in any food production process. The quality depends on the source of water and the actual application in food production. The pollution of water occurs at any stage in various ways. Physical, chemical, or biological agents cause significant health hazards in safe production of food. Contamination of water by several pathological microorganisms creates major challenges in food safety and threats to human and animal health. The majority of diseases which are transmitted through contaminated fresh water, are caused by pathogenic microorganisms. Whenever water is used as an ingredient in food product, it must be free from undesirable taste, odor, color, and impurities, including pathogenic organisms that could jeopardize consumers’ health and gravely affect product quality. The quality of water must adhere to the safe drinking water standard. Various techniques and methods of water treatments should be used to purify water as per the guidelines of government authorities to improve food safety. Soil has multiple roles in deciding water quality. Good quality soil has better ability to remove all types of contaminants of water, whereas deteriorated soil becomes a source of heavy metals, organic chemicals, and soil pathogens in water contamination. Use of genetically modified food is gaining much publicity recently. Even though a controversial topic, great care must be taken when genetically modified food is used. It is mandatory that one should review the basic principles of food safety before consuming any food.","30fb77bb67dd41ee831fc9ed1cffc80e5c41761b","True","Food Safety and Human Health","over 100|between 6 and 20|Soil","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-816333-7.00009-6","custom_license"

Human models have provided direct evidence that RV infection is capable of exacerbating chronic respiratory diseases and identified immunological processes that correlate with clinical disease outcomes. Mice are the most commonly used nonhuman experimental RV infection model. Although semipermissive, under defined experimental conditions sufficient replication occurs to induce host immune responses that recapitulate immunity and disease during human infection. The capacity to use genetically modified mouse strains and drug interventions has shown the mouse model to be an invaluable research tool defining causal relationships between host immunity and disease and supporting development of new treatments. Used in combination the insights achieved from human and animal experimental infection models provide complementary insights into RV biology and yield novel therapeutic options to reduce the burden of RV-induced disease.","3b4bc962d72c33b624a9da08ab94b1c0253eeb4c","True","Rhinovirus Infections","RV|RV|RV|RV|RV","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-816417-4.00008-1","custom_license"

Over the years, CDs have shown promising application potential in different areas, ranging from controlled drug release to chiral separation of basic drugs. These applications are largely mediated by the ability of CDs to undergo host–guest inclusion complexation. Upon incorporation of CDs into the design of a polymeric vector, not only can the flexibility of the design be increased, but the development of a multifunctional carrier for genetic manipulation can also be facilitated.","fdffb7dbef5e52f33089bd92d58af50e02041b37","True","Delivery of Therapeutics for Biogerontological Interventions","Abstract Technologies|the years","els-covid","","","","ORG|DATE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-816485-3.00005-2","custom_license"

Nanotechnology today provides hope as an alternative to antibiotics, in the field of antimicrobial therapy. The diverse structures and small size make the nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit unique and remarkable properties, drastically different from its bulk counterparts. Various microorganisms such as actinomycetes, algae, yeast, fungi, and bacteria synthesize inorganic nanoparticles enzymatically, either extracellularly or intracellularly. Various metallic NPs, for example, magnesium, titanium, copper, silver, and gold, are well reported for their antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. The antimicrobial properties of these NPs may be attributed to its ability to disorganize membrane structure, form pores in the bacterial cell wall, inhibit or disruption biofilm, etc. Most metal oxide nanoparticles like ZnO-NPs, exhibit bactericidal properties by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, other NPs like MgO-NPs are effective due to their peculiar physical structure. Nanoparticles can also be fabricated with various bioactive entities. Due to their small and controllable size, functionalized nanoparticles can deliver drugs precisely and safely to the target sites. Thus, microbial mediated production of nanoparticles is gaining substantial interest as a potential solution to the growing need for the development of eco-friendly ways to fight microbial resistance and control diseases.","1877e84c632c92040e538aae2f207c1d7b05c379","True","Nanoparticles in Pharmacotherapy","MDR|today|ZnO|MgO-NPs|Nanoparticles","els-covid","","","","ORG|DATE|ORG|PRODUCT|PERSON","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-816504-1.00008-9","custom_license"

Today, virologists are beginning to think of viruses as living organisms that can be classified phylogenetically into defined species, much like any other living organism. The primary reasons for this shift in attitude can be partially attributed to the discovery of giant viruses, having large genomes and complex regulatory systems. Aside from that, it has become obvious that viruses lead complex lives; they evolve, speciate, and participate in the evolution of all classes of living organisms. In this chapter, we will discuss the early attempts to classify viruses, and review the biologic properties of the classes of virus that contain human pathogens.","095094d4972c48a1d2f149cbd8cbd3b86c542fae","True","Taxonomic Guide to Infectious Diseases","Today","els-covid","","","","DATE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-817576-7.00007-9","custom_license"
"Berman, Jules J.","Chapter 8 Changing how we think about infectious diseases","Abstract As we learn more and more about the classes of organisms that infect humans, we are discovering that many organisms, including pathogenic organisms, may have a complex relationship with humans in which infection seldom results in the production disease. In some cases, infection may be just one biological event that occurs during a multievent process that develops sequentially, over time, and involves genetic and environmental factors that may vary among individuals. Consequently, the role of infectious organisms in the development of human disease may not meet all of the criteria normally required to determine when an organism can be called the cause of a disease. This chapter reviews the expanding role of infections in the development of human disease. We discuss prion diseases of humans, a fascinating example of an infectious disease-causing agent that is not a living organism. We also discuss the diseases of unknown etiology for which infectious organisms may play a role. In addition, this chapter reviews some of the misconceptions and recurring errors associated with the classification of infectious diseases that have led to misdiagnoses and have impeded our understanding of the role of organisms in the development of human diseases.","6a41d992081fd4a451392a1fee3373659ab8ca9e","True","Taxonomic Guide to Infectious Diseases","one","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-12-817576-7.00008-0","custom_license"

Several examples from all around the world have been quoted to highlight different incidents of bioterrorism across the world. After addressing vicious epidemics, several laboratory methods for detection and surveillance for bioterrorism have been elaborated. The case studies of bioterrorism in terms of warfare highlight use of bioweapons at political fronts. Similarly, the success story of controlling bird flu and advent and persistence of dengue show the status of bioterrorism and Pakistan's preparedness to deal with this menace. Pakistan has strengthened itself to deal with bioterrorism by adopting different national and global tools for governance.

The dynamics of transmission and the strategies for preventing infection transmission in health care institutions are discussed. Anesthesiologists have long been patient safety advocates and have taken on increasing responsibility for preventing health care–associated infections. Anesthesia providers practice in a nonsterile environment within the operating room and have an impact on bacterial transmission and infection rates. Understanding the characteristics of transmission elements provides the practicing anesthesiologist with methods to protect susceptible patients and themselves to avoid spreading infection. It is vital to have in place proper systems to remove contaminated air to minimize the risk of airborne pathogens being transmitted by children. Preoperative patient skin and other bacterial reservoir decontamination and hand hygiene by anesthesia providers reduces contamination of the work area and IV access ports. Hand hygiene is a well-known and effective solution to the problem of bacterial transmission within and across patients and is considered the most important and cost-effective individual intervention in the prevention of health care–associated infections in children and health care providers Compliance with the current “5 moments” World Health Organization guidelines could make a major inroad into reducing provider hand and workspace contamination. Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis is an essential tool to reduce the risk of postoperative infections, and the anesthesia team plays a central role in ensuring the proper timing of drug administration.

Detection of likely etiologic agents of respiratory infections can help direct management and can also play an important role in disease surveillance. For this purpose, we are still reliant on many traditional diagnostic tools that have been used for decades in order to determine the microbial etiology of respiratory infections. However, these tools have been increasingly supplemented by newer methods, particular molecular diagnostic techniques, which have enabled the more rapid detection of many pathogens that were previously difficult to detect. These advances have particularly lead to improvements in the ability to detect respiratory viruses and also other microorganisms that do not normally colonize the respiratory tract. Recognition of the existence of the lung microbiome has challenged the traditional views of pneumonia pathogenesis and may provide the opportunity for new diagnostic tools that are focused on more than just detection of specific known pathogens.

"Balfour-Lynn, Ian Michael; Wright, Marie","23 Acute Infections That Produce Upper Airway Obstruction","Abstract This chapter discusses the common and potentially serious infective causes of acute upper airway obstruction in children. The laryngeal anatomy of young children makes them particularly susceptible to upper airway obstruction, and during acute infections this is exacerbated by inflammation and edema of the airway mucosa. The most common cause of infective upper airway obstruction in children is viral laryngotracheobronchitis, or croup, which is usually a mild and self-limiting illness, but management with corticosteroids may still be necessary. Bacterial causes of upper airway obstruction have fortunately become rare since the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae B (HiB) immunization, but a few cases of epiglottitis do still occur due to nonimmunization, vaccine failure, and infection with non-HiB organisms. These cases constitute a medical emergency due to the risk of rapid progression to complete airway obstruction. Other rare conditions are discussed including bacterial tracheitis, diphtheria, retropharyngeal, and peritonsillar abscesses. Key learning points in this chapter include the main discriminating factors of the various causes of infective upper airway obstruction, the importance of a calm and minimally distressing approach to the child presenting with stridor, and the need for early anesthetic team involvement in cases with a suspected bacterial etiology or signs of impending airway obstruction.","508f04c31e56be8a13f63aa5689d0de750ebc978","True","Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children","Haemophilus|HiB","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-323-44887-1.00023-7","custom_license"
"Cunningham, Steve","24 Bronchiolitis","Abstract Acute viral bronchiolitis is a common viral lower respiratory tract infection in young children. Most typically caused by respiratory syncytial virus in 70% of cases, the condition lasts for 4 to 7 days, with a prolonged cough in many. Children with comorbidity, particularly those born prematurely or with significant congenital heart disease, are at risk of more severe disease. Nasal obstruction progresses over 3 to 4 days to difficulty with feeding and increased work of breathing with hypoxemia. Crackles and/or wheeze may be auscultated. Apnoea may be a presenting sign in those less than 3 months of age. Viral load is highest at peak of symptoms and in those with more severe disease. Approximately 2% to 3% of all children are admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis. The differential diagnosis may include bacterial pneumonia, congenital lesions of the lung or heart, or an interstitial lung disease. There are no effective treatments, and admission is for feeding support (by nasogastric or intravenous fluids) or treatment of hypoxemia. Critical care support is required for some infants experiencing respiratory failure, though mortality rates remain unchanged. Practice within and between countries varies significantly and alignment of practice is a common goal of guidelines. Vaccines for RSV are in advanced development, as are several antiviral therapies for RSV. In most children, acute symptoms improve within 5 to 7 days and cough by 2 weeks. Recurrent wheeze is common following acute bronchiolitis and a good association with a diagnosis of asthma in childhood.","5d5018dc9287a58f4aabd9b9e7617ab572acc62c","True","Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children","70%|4 to 7 days|3 to 4 days|those less than 3 months of age|Approximately 2% to 3%|RSV|RSV|5 to 7 days|2 weeks|Recurrent","els-covid","","","","PERCENT|DATE|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|TIME|DATE|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-323-44887-1.00024-9","custom_license"
"Chang, Anne B.; Redding, Gregory J.","26 Bronchiectasis and Chronic Suppurative Lung Disease","Abstract Bronchiectasis, chronic suppurative lung disease, and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) are increasingly recognized conditions. Bronchiectasis is now again increasingly diagnosed, and its renewed interest has resulted in further in-depth studies in children and adults. However, diagnostic labeling of childhood bronchiectasis by radiology using adult-derived criteria has substantial limitations. Thus, pediatric-derived criteria are advocated. A paradigm presenting a spectrum related to airway bacteria, with associated degradation and inflammation products causing airway damage if untreated, entails PBB (at the mild end) to irreversible airway dilatation with cystic formation as determined by chest computed tomography (CT) scan (at the severe end of the spectrum). Increasing evidence suggest that progression of airway damage can be limited by intensive treatment, even in those predestined to have bronchiectasis (e.g., immune deficiency). Treatment is aimed at achieving a cure in those at the milder end of the spectrum to limiting further deterioration in those with severe “irreversible” radiological bronchiectasis.

"Tambyah, Paul; Isa, Mas Suhaila; Tan, Christelle Xian-Ting","28 New and Emerging Infections of the Lung","Abstract In this era of rapid globalization and frequent travel, emerging viral infections have gained an immense potential to spread at an unprecedented speed and scale compared with the past. This poses a significant challenge to coordinated international efforts in global surveillance and infection control. Significantly, respiratory viral infections, spread mostly via droplet transmission, are extremely contagious and have caused significant morbidity and mortality during outbreaks in the last decade. Molecular diagnostics via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been key in the rapid diagnosis of most of these viral infections. However, a high index of suspicion and early institution of appropriate isolation measures remain as the mainstay in the control and containment of the spread of these viral infections. Although treatment for most of the viral infections remains supportive, efficacious antiviral agents against influenza infections exist. The infections discussed in this chapter include those first described in the 2000s: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and metapneumovirus and rhinovirus C as well as those that have been described in the past but have reemerged in the last decade in outbreaks resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, including adenovirus, influenza virus, and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).","7fbc60e0d0cc867609bf33d1af4e3431b0d53f1d","True","Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children","the last decade|RT-PCR|first|the 2000s|Middle East|the last decade|D68|D68","els-covid","","","","DATE|ORG|ORDINAL|DATE|LOC|DATE|PERSON|PERSON","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-323-44887-1.00028-6","custom_license"
"Grigg, Jonathan; Ducharme, Francine M.","44 Asthma in the Preschool Age Child","Abstract Wheeze in preschool children (5 years of age and younger) is common. The majority of severe episodes are triggered by viral colds. Unlike atopic asthma in adults and young people, the underlying pathology of this condition is poorly understood, and the label of “preschool wheeze” should therefore not be regarded as a diagnosis but a description of symptoms. It is important to consider other causes of wheeze, but, for the most part, serious conditions such as cystic fibrosis and foreign body aspiration are associated with atypical features on careful history and examination. There remain significant uncertainties about the optimal management of children with this condition. Short-acting bronchodilators are indicated for the acute treatment of wheeze, and current evidence suggests that daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy is an effective preventive therapy, at least in a subgroup of children.

"Cawcutt, Kelly A.; Zimmer, Andrea","Chapter 95 Management of Infection in Patients With Kidney Transplant","Abstract With the pervasive nature of chronic kidney disease, kidney transplantation is likely to continue to increase in the coming years. There are many infectious risks related to kidney transplant, including reactivation of latent infections, surgical complications, infectious risks related to immunosuppression, and nosocomial and community-acquired infections. These are described classically via timeline with early infections (first month), middle (1 to 6 months), and late (after 6 months). Kidney transplant patients may suffer from infections secondary to a vast array of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Certain infections, particularly viral infections such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and BK virus, may portend acute and chronic implications of the infection and its subsequent impact on graft function. Critical care physicians and nephrologists caring for patients with a renal transplant must understand the broad array of possible infections, atypical presentations, and nuanced implications for appropriate evaluation and subsequent therapy, combined with the need for possible prophylaxis and/or suppression. Multidisciplinary teams, including transplant physicians and infectious diseases physicians, are encouraged strongly.","edf3b05c1aced395bde43ecf269fdc5e5a72a805","True","Critical Care Nephrology","the coming years|(first month|1 to 6 months|6 months|Kidney|Epstein|BK|Multidisciplinary","els-covid","","","","DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-323-44942-7.00095-9","custom_license"

This chapter is organized primarily as a general discussion of the clinical problem of pneumonia. As appropriate, the focus on individual etiologic agents highlights some characteristic features of each that are particularly useful to the physician. Also covered is a commonly used categorization of pneumonia based on the clinical setting: community-acquired versus nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia. In current clinical practice, the approach to evaluation and management of these two types of pneumonia is often quite different. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of several infections that were uncommon or primarily of historical interest until recently, as the threat of bioterrorism emerged. In addition to reviewing inhalational anthrax, the chapter briefly describes two other organisms considered to be of concern as potential weapons of bioterrorism: Yersinia pestis (the cause of plague) and Francisella tularensis (the cause of tularemia).","0e4dd2e8a1b942a33f564855d6fd8444d398c442","True","Principles of Pulmonary Medicine","two|Yersinia|Francisella","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-323-52371-4.00026-X","custom_license"

"Fishman, Jay A.; Costa, Sylvia F.; Alexander, Barbara D.","31 Infection in Kidney Transplant Recipients","Abstract In organ transplant recipients, impaired inflammatory responses suppress the clinical and radiologic findings of infection. The possible etiologies of infection are diverse, ranging from common bacterial and viral pathogens that affect the entire community to opportunistic pathogens that cause invasive disease only in immunocompromised hosts. Antimicrobial therapies required to treat established infection are often complex, with accompanying risks for drug toxicities and drug interactions with the immunosuppressive agents used to maintain graft function. Rapid and specific diagnosis is essential for successful therapy. The risk of serious infections in the organ transplant patient is largely determined by the interaction between two factors: the patient’s epidemiologic exposures and the patient’s net state of immunosuppression. The epidemiology of infection includes environmental exposures and nosocomial infections, organisms derived from donor tissues, and latent infections from the recipient activated with immunosuppression. The net state of immune suppression is a conceptual framework that measures those factors contributing to risk for infection: the dose, duration, and temporal sequence of immunosuppressive drugs; the presence of foreign bodies or injuries to mucocutaneous barriers; neutropenia; metabolic abnormalities including diabetes; devitalized tissues, hematomas, or effusions postsurgery; and infection with immunomodulating viruses. Multiple factors are present in each host. A timeline exists to aid in the development of a differential diagnosis for infection. The timeline for each patient is altered by changes in prophylaxis and immunosuppressive drugs. For common infections, new microbiologic assays, often nucleic acid based, are useful in the diagnosis and management of opportunistic infections.","c8038392ec9599f16ac10c3b0ce3be01a7dfc275","True","Kidney Transplantation - Principles and Practice","two","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-323-53186-3.00031-0","custom_license"

In addition to vaccinations and malaria chemoprophylaxis, a pretravel consultation should include advice on regionally endemic or emerging non–vaccine-preventable infections that can cause severe illness or chronic morbidity. These include mosquito-borne infections such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and regionally endemic severe respiratory infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and some strains of avian influenza. Zika virus is notable given its capacity for sexual transmission and association with congenital birth defects. Preventive advice for other potentially relevant infections associated with specific exposures or activities (e.g., schistosomiasis and leptospirosis from freshwater exposure) should be provided where relevant. Understanding the epidemiology and prevention of these infections is crucial to providing a comprehensive pretravel consultation.","a87be17751e520445a240f2560e6b302644a4d30","True","Travel Medicine","Zika|Middle East|Preventive","els-covid","","","","PERSON|LOC|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-323-54696-6.00007-0","custom_license"

Millions visit these areas, and each year thousands appear in hospitals with posttravel acute malaria. That diagnosis should be managed as a medical emergency. Illness may deteriorate rapidly without prompt diagnosis and effective treatment. Among five species of Plasmodium responsible for human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum most often deteriorates rapidly, but all species potentially threaten life. Malignant and benign species of malaria parasites is a dangerous fallacy. Clinical malaria mimics other common tropical infections and the diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation, but malaria-like symptoms in a patient exposed to risk should be presumed to be malaria until proven otherwise. Intravenous or intramuscular artesunate is used for severe malaria of any species in any patient, including all trimesters of pregnancy. Primaquine is administered with vivax or ovale malarias after affirming glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)–normal status.","45c8b7c74291445ba628191ceb64ecb653b1f2f0","True","Travel Medicine","Nearly 3 billion|Millions|each year thousands|five","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-323-54696-6.00017-3","custom_license"

Humanitarian aid workers (HAWs) typically travel for extended periods, work in close proximity to local populations, and work in high-risk environments in low-resource regions. Owing to the nature of their work, HAWs are often unable to avoid high-risk behaviors and frequently encounter stressful conditions, leading to psychologic repercussions. Although morbidity might be high, death during volunteer missions is not common and it is usually not attributable to infectious diseases. Medical evacuations are also not common. One unique aspect of ill-returning HAWs might be their threat to public health in their home countries, as was demonstrated in the 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Thus pretravel and posttravel physical and psychologic screening evaluations, in addition to routine health care, are essential for this population.","86692fc6d65efc5609c8530525db77f77f18b602","True","Travel Medicine","One|2014–2015|West Africa","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-323-54696-6.00035-5","custom_license"

Although infectious diseases are most feared due to the potential for rapid international spread, noncommunicable diseases, accidents, and stampedes are more frequent. Mass gatherings may lead to three potential infectious disease public health threats: the risk of importation of infectious diseases usually not seen in the country of the gathering; the amplification of transmission during the event; and the international spread of infectious disease through global mobility networks.","45beb78659a02363232ed0b3123e44a45b60a21f","True","Travel Medicine","three","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-323-54696-6.00041-0","custom_license"

The aircraft cabin is pressurized to maintain an effective altitude below 8000 feet, which provides adequate protection for healthy travelers. Those individuals with cardiopulmonary impairment or other conditions affecting fitness to travel should seek advice from the airline in consultation with their medical provider. People are the primary source of microorganisms in aircraft cabins and are the most important reservoirs of infectious agents on aircraft. Recirculated cabin air is filtered to remove microorganisms, but this does not prevent person-to-person spread of infectious disease in vulnerable people. The World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention produce guidelines; and people with febrile illnesses should postpone air travel.","fcae60dc1a37f467c1d95884787e1e3283dc769e","True","Travel Medicine","Atmospheric|above about 10,000 feet|below 8000 feet|The World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","els-covid","","","","ORG|QUANTITY|QUANTITY|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-323-54696-6.00047-1","custom_license"

"Moore, Mark A.; Samsell, Brian; McLean, Julie","Chapter 5 Allograft Tissue Safety and Technology","Abstract Allograft tissues are commonly used by orthopedic surgeons and are processed using a variety of technologies to increase safety and clinical use. For safety, although disease transmission is a tangible risk, this possibility has been dramatically minimized through modern tissue-processing methods. These include steps to prevent processing tissues with unacceptable bioburden through rigorous screening using donor medical and social histories along with microbial testing of recovered tissue and viral testing of donor serum. Potential bioburden is also controlled through aseptic recovery and processing methods and then reduced through disinfection steps that can include antibiotics, detergents, mechanical process, chemical solutions, and terminal sterilization. Processing steps may also include decellularization methods to lower immunogenic potential of some tissues. To enhance fusion potential of bone void fillers, demineralization steps may be used, and the resultant demineralized bone matrices may be combined with a carrier to improve handling. Bone void fillers and osteochondral allografts may also be specially processed to retain a living cellular component. To preserve relevant biological, biochemical, and physical properties of allografts for clinical use and ease of handling, a number of methods may be used which include: (1) refrigeration in media, (2) freeze-drying, (3) cryopreservation, (4) freezing, and (5) media storage at room temperature. As academic and industry research continue to drive advances, the future direction of allograft tissue likely includes injectables, coatings, cellular therapies, and combinations with other materials. The technology approaches outlined here will be further described along with future directions.","f76d1232bed4d35c275586cae342338b4cb5d9d6","True","Biologics in Orthopaedic Surgery","Allograft|1|2|3|4|5","els-covid","","","","PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/B978-0-323-55140-3.00005-9","custom_license"

However, in disease endemic settings across many parts of the globe, most of the disease control interventions accounts for small and large ruminants, whereas unusual hosts and/or natural reservoirs, such as camels, remain neglected for disease control measures including routine vaccination. Such a policy drawback not only plays an important role in disease epizootiology particularly in settings where disease is endemic, but also serves an obstacle in disease control and subsequent eradication in future. With this background, using pre-validated ELISA and molecular assays [multiplex PCR, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and real-time (rt)-PCR], we conducted a large-scale pathogen- and antibody-based surveillance for brucellosis, peste des petits ruminants and bluetongue in camel population (n = 992) originating from a wide geographical region in southern part of the Punjab province, Pakistan. Varying in each of the selected districts, the seroprevalence was found to be maximum for bluetongue [n = 697 (70.26%, 95% CI: 67.29–73.07)], followed by PPR [n = 193 (19.46%, 95% CI: 17.07–22.09)] and brucellosis [n = 66 (6.65%, 95% CI: 5.22–8.43)]. Odds of seroprevalence were more significantly associated with pregnancy status (non-pregnant, OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.86–5.63, p<0.01), farming system (mixed-animal, OR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.56–4.29, p<0.01), breed (Desi, OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.28–4.03, p<0.01) and farmer education (illiterate, OR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.45–6.93, p<0.01) for BTV, body condition (normal, OR = 3.54, 95% CI: 1.92–6.54, p<0.01) and breed (Desi, OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.09–4.40, p<0.01) for brucellosis, and feeding system for PPR (grazing, OR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.79–4.22, p<0.01). Among the total herds included (n = 74), genome corresponding to BT virus (BTV) and brucellosis was detected in 14 (18.92%, 95 CI: 11.09–30.04) and 19 herds (25.68%, 95% CI: 16.54–37.38), respectively. None of the herds was detected with genome of PPR virus (PPRV). Among the positive herds, serotype 1, 8 and 11 were detected for BTV while all the herds were exclusively positive to B. abortus. Taken together, the study highlights the role of potential disease reservoirs in the persistence and transmission of selected diseases in their susceptible hosts and, therefore, urges necessary interventions (e.g., inclusion of camels for vaccine etc.) for the control of diseases from their endemic setting worldwide.","1a6a8d1a6dae017a2003523665369725079d4aa0","True","Acta Tropica","PPR|BT|ELISA|992|Punjab province|Pakistan|697|70.26%|95%|CI|PPR|193|19.46%|95%|CI|17.07–22.09|66|6.65%|95%|CI|5.22–8.43|2.23|95%|CI|1.86–5.63|2.59|95%|CI|1.56–4.29|Desi|1.97|95%|CI|1.28–4.03|3.17|95%|CI|1.45–6.93|BTV|3.54|95%|CI|1.92–6.54|Desi|2.19|95%|CI|1.09–4.40|PPR|2.75|95%|CI|1.79–4.22|74|BT|BTV|14|18.92%|95|CI|11.09–30.04|19|25.68%|95%|CI|16.54–37.38|PPR|1|8|11|BTV|B.","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP","Elsevier","2020-05-31","","10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105435","custom_license"

This study aimed to assess the confidence and its predictors in HMPX case management among general practitioners (GPs), the frontline doctors in Indonesia, and to explore their perspectives on HMPX. Between May and July 2019, GPs in Indonesia completed an online-based survey. The questionnaire collected information on GPs’ confidence, perspective, sociodemographic, workplace and professional characteristics, exposure to HMPX information and knowledge on HMPX. A logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the explanatory variables influencing the confidence and the perspective. We included 395 GPs in our analysis (77.4% out of 510 responses received) of which 10.1% and 34.9% were classified having good confidence using an 80% and 70% cut-off for confidence score, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, receiving information about HMPX during medical training was the only variable significantly associated with good confidence (adjusted odds ratio 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 4.78 and p<0.001). Approximately 73.6% and 77.9% of GPs agreed that HMPX is an important infectious disease and it has potential to detrimentally impact the Indonesian economy, respectively. In addition, 88.8% of GPs suggested that the disease should be incorporated into the National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia. In conclusion, in case of HMPX outbreak, majority of the GPs in Indonesia seem to be less confident in diagnosing and treating cases, using their current knowledge, skills and their workplace facilities. Therefore, a systematic strategy to improve their confidence in managing HMPX is required.","42329ca02f8aca5ffff0437e9f9675c3ba580e12","True","Acta Tropica","HMPX|Asia|HMPX|HMPX|Indonesia|HMPX|Between May and July 2019|Indonesia|GPs’|HMPX|HMPX|395|77.4%|510|10.1%|34.9%|an 80% and 70%|HMPX|2.74|95%|1.57|4.78|p<0.001|Approximately 73.6%|77.9%|HMPX|Indonesian|88.8%|the National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia|HMPX|Indonesia|HMPX","els-covid","","","","ORG|LOC|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|NORP|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-03-16","","10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105450","custom_license"

Recently, DNA-based materials have attracted substantial consideration for the exploration of smart hydrogels, in which their properties can change in response to chemical or physical stimuli. In other words, these gels can undergo switchable gel-to-sol or sol-to-gel transitions upon application of different triggers. Moreover, various functional motifs like i-motif structures, antisense DNAs, DNAzymes, and aptamers can be inserted into the polymer network to offer a molecular recognition capability to the complex. In this manuscript, a comprehensive discussion will be endowed with the recognition capability of different kinds of DNA hydrogels and the alternation in physicochemical behaviors upon target introducing. Finally, we offer a vision into the future landscape of DNA based hydrogels in sensing applications.","5131c8c19a90bd84b3f8146eec14ad48aadcde41","True","Advances in Colloid and Interface Science","DNAs|DNAzymes","els-covid","","","31739981","ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.cis.2019.102060","custom_license"
"Katsura, Yukako; Asai, Satoshi","Evolutionary Medicine of Retroviruses in the Human Genome","ABSTRACT Humans are infected with many viruses, and the immune system mostly removes viruses and the infected cells. However, certain viruses have entered the human genome. Of the human genome, ∼45% is composed of transposable elements (long interspersed nuclear elements [LINEs], short interspersed nuclear elements [SINEs] and transposons) and 5-8% is derived from viral sequences with similarity to infectious retroviruses. If integration of retrovirus occurs in a germline, the integrated viral sequences are heritable. Accumulation of viral sequences has created the current human genome. This article summarizes recent studies of retroviruses in humans and bridges clinical fields and evolutionary genetics. First, we report the repertories of human-infective retroviruses. Second, we review endogenous retroviruses in the human genome and diseases associated with endogenous retroviruses. Third, we discuss the biological functions of endogenous retroviruses and propose the concept of accelerated human evolution via viruses. Finally, we present perspectives of virology in the field of evolutionary medicine.","0267ea0cfef9e90f5e60e97839370e11c253f17b","True","The American Journal of the Medical Sciences","∼45%|5-8%|First|Second|Third","els-covid","","","31813465","PERCENT|PERCENT|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.amjms.2019.09.007","custom_license"
"Guo, Lulu; Lu, Baiyang; Dong, Qing; Tang, Yidan; Du, Yan; Li, Bingling","One-tube smart genetic testing via coupling isothermal amplification and three-way nucleic acid circuit to glucometers","Abstract Urgent demand for portable diagnosis has promoted a new sensing strategy that uses personal glucometer (PGM) to detect non-glucose targets. Even though great progresses have been achieved in terms of target range and sensing principle, issues such as low final signal-to-background ratio and hard-to-realize one-tube smart analysis still exist and challenge real-world applications in gene detection. Here we propose a practical solution via coupling isothermal amplification (i.e. LAMP) and three-way amplifiable catalytic hairpin assembly (i.e. CHA) to a PGM. It allows direct transduction from genomic information to commercial portable devices with all of ultra-high sensitivity, specificity and enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Compared with previous report without signal amplification, the introduction of CHA has successfully improved the signal amplitude by at least 12.5 folds. More importantly, through importing an effective three-way junction based transduction, we also innovatively develop a one-tube logical or multiplex analysis strategy in PGM based detection. Totally four situations of two foodborne bacteria genes, in Cronobacter sakazakii (ompA) and Escherichia coli (malB), could be directly readout using the final PGM signals, with the lowest detection amount down to less than 100 molecular copies (6.6 × 10−18 M). It is believed such a LAMP-CHA-PGM method has been already sensitive, specific, and of great potential for practically portable gene diagnostics.","a186e1e74616d4936c8de93c42a857c4cb9d1edf","True","Analytica Chimica Acta","PGM|LAMP|three|PGM|CHA|at least 12.5|three|one|PGM|four|two|Cronobacter|Escherichia|malB|PGM|less than 100|6.6|LAMP|PGM","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-04-15","","10.1016/j.aca.2020.01.068","custom_license"

These two AMPs effectively inhibit the growth of human pathogenic fungi in micromolar concentrations and exhibit antiviral potential without causing cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. The antifungal mechanism of action of both AMPs is closely linked to - but not solely dependent on - the lipid composition of the fungal cell membrane and requires a strictly regulated protein uptake into the cell, indicating that PAF and PAFB are not canonical membrane active proteins. Variations in their antifungal spectrum and their killing dynamics point towards a divergent mode of action related to their physicochemical properties and surface charge distribution. In this review, we relate characteristic features of PAF and PAFB to the current knowledge about other AMPs of different sources. In addition, we present original data that have never been published before to substantiate our assumptions and provide evidences that help to explain and understand better the mechanistic function of PAF and PAFB.

"Woo, Jiwon; Lee, Eunice Yoojin; Lee, Mirae; Kim, Taeyeon; Cho, Yong-Eun","An in vivo cell-based assay for investigating the specific interaction between the SARS-CoV N-protein and its viral RNA packaging sequence","Abstract The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein serves multiple functions in viral replication, transcription, and assembly of the viral genome complex. Coronaviruses specifically package genomic RNA into assembled virions, and in SARS-CoV, it is reported that this process is driven by an interaction between the N-protein and a packaging signal encoded within the viral RNA. While recent studies have uncovered the sequence of this packaging signal, little is known about the specific interaction between the N-protein and the packaging signal sequence, and the mechanisms by which this interaction drives viral genome packaging. In this study, we developed a novel in vivo cell-based assay for examining this interaction between the N-protein and packaging signal RNA for SARS-CoV, as well as other viruses within the coronaviridae family. Our results demonstrate that the N-protein specifically recognizes the SARS-CoV packaging signal with greater affinity compared to signals from other coronaviruses or non-coronavirus species. We also use deletion mapping to identify a 151-nt region within the packaging signal sequence that is critical for N-protein-RNA binding, and conversely, we show that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the N protein are necessary for recognizing the packaging RNA. These results describe, for the first time, in vivo evidence for an interaction between the SARS-CoV N-protein and its packaging signal RNA, and demonstrate the feasibility of using this cell-based assay to further probe viral RNA-protein interactions in future studies.","e74c09fac1f951aa3859885662c702089ba95c80","True","Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","RNA|RNA|RNA|CoV|CoV|151-nt|RNA|RNA|first|CoV|RNA|RNA","els-covid","","","31594639","ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-10","","10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.09.115","custom_license"
"Lai, Zheng-Zong; Ho, Yi-Jung; Lu, Jeng-Wei","Cephalotaxine inhibits Zika infection by impeding viral replication and stability","Abstract The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has reemerged as a serious public health problem around the world. Syndromes of infected people range from asymptomatic infections to severe neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly. Screening anti-ZIKV drugs derived from Chinese medicinal herbs is one method of identifying antiviral agents. In this paper, we report that (1) Cephalotaxine (CET), an alkaloid isolated from Cephalotaxus drupacea, was effective in inhibiting ZIKV activity in vitro (i.e., in Vero and A549 cell lines) and (2) the mechanisms which underlie these effects involve virucidal activity and a decrease in viral replication. Specifically, CET was found to decrease ZIKV RNA and viral protein expression, inhibit ZIKV replication, and inhibit ZIKV mRNA/protein production. We also determined that CET is effective in inhibiting dengue virus 1–4 (DENV1-4). Taken together, our findings indicate that CET could be an effective lead compound in the treatment of ZIKV and also suggest that further investigation and development of CET-derived drugs may lead to a new class of anti-Flavivirus medications.","00e7af2188897d57226ae59ebf7874882ff928a3","True","Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","Zika|ZIKV|Guillain-Barré|Chinese|one|Cephalotaxine (CET|Cephalotaxus|Vero|2|CET|ZIKV RNA|ZIKV|ZIKV mRNA|CET|1–4 (DENV1-4)|CET|ZIKV|CET|Flavivirus","els-covid","","","31818462","PERSON|PERSON|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|GPE|PRODUCT","Elsevier","2020-02-19","","10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.12.012","custom_license"
"Lippi, Giuseppe; Plebani, Mario; Michael Henry, Brandon","Thrombocytopenia is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections: A meta-analysis","Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease with lack of established laboratory markers available to evaluate illness severity. In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. Methods An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. Results Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31×109/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -29×109/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48×109/L; 95% CI, -57 to -39×109/L. In the four studies (n=1427) which reported data on rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6). Conclusions Low platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization.","45f82c4c5a222af95b1967059617a651f39d87e4","True","Clinica Chimica Acta","2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|Medline|Scopus|COVID-19|WMD|COVID-19|COVID-19|Nine|1779|COVID-19|399|22.4%|COVID-19|WMD|95%|CI|WMD|95%|CI|four|COVID-19|OR|5.1|95%|CI|1.8|Conclusions Low|COVID-19","els-covid","","","","DATE|ORG|PERSON|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|LAW|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-03-13","","10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022","custom_license"

Few data are available that quantify feed and water consumption, as well as growth, in healthy versus non-healthy calves—the objective of this study. A database of Holstein calves (<1 wk of age; n = 313) was developed to compare calves that developed diarrhea in the first 21 d after arrival from commercial farms to the research facility versus calves that remained healthy. Individual calf data from 4 experiments included daily intake of milk replacer, free water, electrolyte solution, and starter grain, as well as weekly body weight (BW) and frame measures for 21 d after arrival. Calves with a fecal score of >2 for ≥3 consecutive days over the first 21 d of each experiment were retrospectively classified as diarrheic (DIA; n = 96); the remainder were classified as healthy (HEA; n = 217). Other health issues were minimal. The likelihood of elevated fecal score occurrence and the cumulative number of days with an elevated score were greater for DIA calves than for HEA calves. The initial total protein concentration in blood did not differ between classifications. Cumulative milk replacer dry matter intake (DMI) and water consumed from milk replacer were significantly less for DIA calves than for HEA calves, because DIA calves were more likely to refuse milk replacer. Cumulative starter DMI was decreased for DIA versus HEA calves. As a result, cumulative total DMI was significantly less for DIA calves than for HEA calves. Cumulative free water intake did not differ between classifications. The DIA calves were more likely to receive electrolyte solution and have more days given electrolyte solution than HEA calves. As a result, total cumulative intake of electrolyte solution was greater in DIA calves than in HEA calves. Cumulative total water intake did not differ between classifications. Initial BW did not differ between classifications; however, a classification × time interaction for BW indicated that HEA calves were heavier than DIA calves and had greater ADG. Significant classification × time interactions for hip height and heart girth revealed that HEA calves had a larger frame size. Gain–feed ratios for both milk replacer intake and total DMI differed between classifications: DIA calves were less feed-efficient than HEA calves. In conclusion, diarrhea in young calves decreases DMI, BW gain, and feed efficiency relative to HEA calves within 21 d of arrival.","b2f09950a0ebc08c28e57c3a9cfb5a1bb3c630b8","True","Journal of Dairy Science","Holstein|1|313|the first 21|4|daily|weekly|21|2|days|the first 21 d of each experiment|DIA|96|HEA|217|DIA|HEA|DIA|HEA|DIA|DMI|DIA|HEA|DMI|DIA|HEA|DIA|more days given electrolyte|HEA|DIA|HEA|Initial BW|BW|HEA|ADG|HEA|DMI|HEA|DMI|HEA|21","els-covid","","","31521358","PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.3168/jds.2019-16609","custom_license"
"Holschbach, C.L.; Raabis, S.M.; Ollivett, T.L.","Effect of antibiotic treatment in preweaned Holstein calves after experimental bacterial challenge with Pasteurella multocida","ABSTRACT The primary objective of this randomized controlled challenge study was to investigate the effect of ampicillin on ultrasonographic (US) lung consolidation after experimental challenge with Pasteurella multocida in preweaned dairy calves. The secondary objectives were to determine whether ampicillin affected respiratory score, gross consolidation, or the detection of P. multocida in lung tissue at postmortem exam (PME). Holstein bull calves (n = 39) were transported to the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine isolation facility at the mean (±SD) age of 52 ± 6 d. After a 7-d acclimation period, 30 calves were inoculated intratracheally with 1010 cfu of ampicillin-sensitive P. multocida. Lung US and respiratory scoring were performed 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-challenge, then US once daily and respiratory scoring twice daily until d 14. Calves were randomized to receive ampicillin [n = 17, treatment (TX), 6.6 mg/kg i.m. once daily for 3 d] or placebo [n = 11, control (CON), saline, equal volume, i.m. once daily for 3 d] when ≥1 cm2 of lung consolidation was observed and ≥6 h had elapsed since challenge. Lung lesions ≥1 cm2 were considered positive for consolidation. Calves were respiratory score positive if ≥2 in 2 or more categories based on the Wisconsin respiratory health score chart. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for US score and respiratory score as a proxy for time with consolidation and clinical respiratory disease, respectively. Gross lung lesions and pathogens were quantified following PME. At the time of first treatment, consolidation had developed in 28/30 calves (TX, n = 17; CON, n = 11) and 6% (1 out of 17) of TX and 9% (1 out of 11) of CON calves had a positive respiratory score. The TX calves had a significantly lower median (interquartile range given in parentheses) AUC for US score [TX: 23 (20, 29), CON: 47 (33, 53)], whereas mean AUC for respiratory score was not different between groups (TX: 93 ± 28, CON: 96 ± 17). On d 14, 70% (12 out of 17) of TX and 100% (11 out of 11) of CON calves had lung consolidation, and 24% (4 out of 17) of TX and 27% (3 out of 11) of CON calves had clinical respiratory disease. On PME, median consolidation was 10% (6, 15) for TX and 10% (2, 28) for CON calves. Lung cultures were positive for P. multocida in 77% (13 out of 17) of TX and 91% (10 out of 11) of CON calves. Lung health benefited from a 3-d ampicillin therapy, but benefits were short-lived. Treatment failures might be due to incomplete resolution of the initial lung infection. Future studies are needed to optimize TX strategies to improve long-term lung health.","66a2dd6ca8b561cce530ee63e8b99890270ecba1","True","Journal of Dairy Science","US|Pasteurella|P.|PME|Holstein|39|the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine|52|30|1010|P.|Lung US|2|6|12|24|US|17|TX|6.6|3|11|CON|daily|3|≥6|≥2|2|Wisconsin|AUC|US|PME|first|28/30|TX|17|CON|11|6%|1|17|TX|9%|1|11|CON|TX|AUC|US|TX|23|20|29|CON|47|33|53|AUC|TX|93 ± 28|CON|96|14|70%|12|17|TX|100%|11|11|CON|24%|4|17|TX|27%|3|11|CON|PME|10%|6, 15|TX|10%|2, 28|CON|P.|77%|13|17|TX|91%|10|11|CON|3-d|TX","els-covid","","","31548072","GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|MONEY|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|GPE|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.3168/jds.2019-16992","custom_license"
"Doré, V.; Foster, D.M.; Ru, H.; Smith, G.W.","Comparison of oral, intravenous, and subcutaneous fluid therapy for resuscitation of calves with diarrhea","ABSTRACT Neonatal diarrhea remains the primary cause of mortality in dairy calves around the world, and optimal treatment protocols are needed. The main goals of therapy are to restore hydration and electrolyte concentrations, correct strong ion (metabolic) acidemia, and provide nutritional support. Administration of oral electrolyte solutions (OES) has long been the primary method used to treat neonatal diarrhea in humans and calves because OES are capable of addressing each of the primary goals of therapy. In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to compare the ability of a commercially available oral electrolyte solution (OES) administered alone or in combination with hypertonic saline with small volumes of IV or SC fluid therapy to resuscitate calves with diarrhea. Thirty-three Holstein calves from 5 to 14 d of age were utilized in this clinical trial. Diarrhea and dehydration were induced by adding sucrose to the milk replacer. In addition, hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone were given orally and furosemide intramuscularly. Depression status, clinical hydration scores, fecal consistency, and body weight were recorded at regular intervals. Treatment began when calves had severe diarrhea and had a decrease in plasma volume of at least 10%. Calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups of 8 to 9 calves per group: (1) OES; (2) OES with hypertonic saline (4 mL/kg, IV); (3) IV fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L); or (4) SC fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L). Treatments were given at 0 and 12 h. Changes in plasma volume, blood pH, electrolyte levels, and physical examination scores were determined before therapy and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after each treatment. All 4 treatments were ultimately successful in improving hydration as well as increasing blood pH; however, animals in both groups that received OES had much faster resuscitation than those in either the IV or SC fluid group. In conclusion, oral electrolyte products remain the gold standard for resuscitating diarrheic calves with moderate dehydration and acidemia and will likely perform better than small volumes of IV lactated Ringer's solution. Subcutaneous fluids by themselves are a poor treatment option and should be only be used as supportive therapy following the initial correction of hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis.","8ee7eb0c21cd237f97882955c224900bcd42602e","True","Journal of Dairy Science","OES|IV)|SC|IV|SC fluid|Thirty-three|Holstein|5|14|Diarrhea|at least 10%|1|4|8|9|1|2|4 mL/kg|3|Ringer|2|4|2|0|12|1|2|4|8|12|4|pH|OES|IV|SC fluid|IV|Ringer","els-covid","","","31606222","ORG|PRODUCT|PERSON|FAC|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.3168/jds.2019-16970","custom_license"

Holstein heifers (n = 1,811) derived from artificial insemination were categorized as (1) daughters of primiparous cows that, consequently, were nonlactating heifers during gestation (Prim-NoL; n = 787); (2) daughters of multiparous cows that did not have any clinical diseases in the previous lactation (Mult-NoCD; n = 638); and (3) daughters of multiparous cows that had at least one clinical disease in the previous lactation (Mult-CD; n = 386). Clinical diseases of the multiparous dams included retained placenta, metritis, mastitis, lameness, and digestive and respiratory problems. Data collected for evaluation of daughters included genotypic and phenotypic characteristics at birth, morbidity, reproductive performance, and culling from birth through 305 d in milk of first lactation. Orthogonal contrasts were used to evaluate the effect of the parity of the dam (Prim-NoL vs. Mult-NoCD + Mult-CD) and the effect of clinical disease occurrence in the previous lactation among multiparous dams (Mult-NoCD vs. Mult-CD). Compared with daughters of multiparous cows, daughters of Prim-NoL were lighter at birth (36 vs. 41 kg), had greater genetic merit for production traits (e.g., genomic estimated breeding value for milk yield: 875 vs. 746 kg), were less likely to leave the herd (17 vs. 28%) and to lose pregnancy as a heifer (9 vs. 14%), calved earlier (703 vs. 711 d old), were less likely to have clinical diseases as a first lactation cow (30 vs. 37%), and had reduced performance in the first lactation when considering their genetic merit (e.g., 305-d yield of energy-corrected milk: 11,270 vs. 11,539 kg). Compared with daughters of Mult-NoCD, daughters of Mult-CD were less likely to have digestive problems as a heifer (17 vs. 27%) and clinical disease as a first lactation cow (32 vs. 42%), but were also more likely to leave the herd as a heifer (32 vs. 25%) even though genetic merit for production traits were similar (e.g., genomic estimated breeding value for milk: 744 vs. 749 kg). In conclusion, both parity and health status of the dam in the previous lactation were associated with morbidity, survival, and performance of their daughters from birth through 305 d in milk of the first lactation and might represent factors affecting developmental programming of dairy heifers in utero.","f61948c2fc2e64b1a265fea108beb0a03df2e5b8","True","Journal of Dairy Science","first|Holstein|1,811|1|Prim|787|2|Mult-NoCD|638|3|at least one|386|305|first|Prim|Mult|Mult-NoCD|Mult|Prim|36|41 kg|875|746 kg|17|28%|9|14%|703|711|first|30|37%|first|11,270|11,539 kg|Mult-NoCD|Mult|17|27%|first|32|42%|32|25%|744|749 kg|305|first","els-covid","","","31677831","ORDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|ORDINAL","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.3168/jds.2019-17083","custom_license"

The objective of this study was to identify pathogen-specific risk factors associated with epidemic respiratory disease in calves. A cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 128 outbreaks (29 dairy, 58 dairy-mixed, and 41 beef) in Belgium (2016–2018). A semiquantitative PCR for 7 respiratory pathogens was done on a pooled nonendoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage sample for each herd. Potential risk factors were collected by questionnaire and derived from the national cattle registration databank. Most outbreaks occurred between October and March, and single and multiple viral infections were detected in 58.6% (75/128) and 13.3% (17/128), respectively. Bovine coronavirus (BCV) was the most frequently isolated virus (38.4%), followed by bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV; 29.4%) and parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI-3; 8.1%). Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni were detected in 33.3, 41.2, 89.1, and 36.4% of the herds, respectively. Specific risk factors for BCV detection were detection of M. haemolytica [odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% confidence interval = 1.1–7.5)], increasing herd size [OR = 1.3 (1.0–1.8) for each increase with 100 animals] and detection of BCV by antigen ELISA on feces in calves in the last year [OR = 3.6 (1.2–11.1)]. A seasonal effect was shown for bRSV only {more in winter compared with autumn [OR = 10.3 (2.8–37.5)]}. Other factors associated with bRSV were PI-3 detection [OR = 13.4 (2.1–86.0)], prevalence of calves with respiratory disease [OR = 1.02 (1.00–1.04) per 1% increase], and number of days with respiratory signs before sampling [OR = 0.99 (0.98–0.99) per day increase]. Next to its association with BCV, M. haemolytica was more frequently detected in herds with 5 to 10 animals per pen [OR = 8.0 (1.4–46.9)] compared with <5 animals, and in herds with sawdust as bedding [OR = 18.3 (1.8–191.6)]. Also, for H. somni, housing on sawdust was a risk factor [OR = 5.2 (1.2–23.0)]. Purchase of cattle [OR = 2.9 (1.0–8.0)] and housing of recently purchased animals in the same airspace [OR = 5.0 (1.5–16.5)] were risk factors for M. bovis. This study identified pathogen-specific risk factors that might be useful for the development of customized control and prevention and for the design of decision support tools to justify antimicrobial use by predicting the most likely pathogen before sampling results are available.","174b240f9833312df0f94609f19e908eaf7e285f","True","Journal of Dairy Science","128|29|58|41|Belgium|7|between October and March|58.6%|75/128|13.3%|Bovine|BCV|38.4%|29.4%|3|PI-3|8.1%|Mannheimia|Pasteurella|Histophilus|33.3|41.2|89.1|36.4%|BCV|M.|2.8|95%|1.1–7.5|1.3 (|1.0–1.8|100|BCV|ELISA|the last year|3.6|seasonal|bRSV|winter|autumn|10.3|bRSV|PI-3|13.4|2.1–86.0|1.02|1.00–1.04|1%|0.99|BCV|M.|5|10|8.0|1.4–46.9|5|18.3|1.8–191.6|H.|2.9|5.0|1.5–16.5","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|NORP|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.3168/jds.2019-17486","custom_license"
"Opgenorth, Julie; Sordillo, Lorraine M.; VandeHaar, Michael J.","Colostrum supplementation with n-3 fatty acids and α-tocopherol alters plasma polyunsaturated fatty acid profile and decreases an indicator of oxidative stress in newborn calves","ABSTRACT Our objective was to characterize the effects of supplementing newborn calves with n-3 fatty acids (FA) and α-tocopherol on blood lipid profiles and oxidant status in early life. Sixteen calves received 0 or 60 mL of 1:1 fish and flaxseed oil with 200 mg of α-tocopherol in 2.8 L of colostrum within 6 h after birth. Colostrum was >22% on the Brix scale. Blood was sampled on d 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 21 after birth for assessment of plasma polyunsaturated FA, α-tocopherol, total serum protein, and oxidant status index, an indirect indicator of oxidative stress that examines the balance between the concentration of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and antioxidant capacity in serum. Health was observed daily. Weight and hip height were recorded at birth, 3 wk, and 8 wk. Data were analyzed with a Mixed procedure of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Treatment did not alter concentration of total protein in blood serum, prevalence of diarrhea or other signs of disease, or rate of growth. Feeding n-3 FA and α-tocopherol increased plasma concentrations of the n-3 FA, including α-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids, with a concomitant decrease in oxidant status index during the first week of life. Concentrations of α-tocopherol decreased with supplementation, but all calves maintained adequate concentrations. Oxidant status index of treated calves returned to the level of control calves by d 14. We conclude that a colostrum supplement of n-3 FA and α-tocopherol is safe to administer to newborn calves, reduces oxidant status in the first week of life, and may improve health and performance.","8b66dc5244f0e4d9a22244995c66e3729e279a8a","True","Journal of Dairy Science","FA|Sixteen|0|60 mL|1:1|200|2.8|6|Colostrum|22%|Brix|1|2|4|7|14|21|FA|daily|3|8|SAS|SAS Institute Inc.|Cary|NC|the n-3 FA|the first week|14|FA|the first week","els-covid","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERCENT|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE","Elsevier","2020-04-30","","10.3168/jds.2019-17380","custom_license"

Colostral growth factors and hormones have beneficial effects on postnatal maturation and may affect substrate utilization and energy expenditure in neonatal calves. We tested the hypothesis that energy metabolism and its endocrine regulation differ during the first 10 d of life in calves fed either colostrum or a milk-based formula with a similar nutrient composition to colostrum, but largely depleted of bioactive substances, for the first 2 d postnatum. Male Holstein calves (n = 18) were fed either pooled colostrum (COL; n = 9) or a milk-based formula (FOR; n = 9) for the first 2 d of life. From d 3 on, all calves received same milk replacer. On d 2 and 7 of life, calves were placed in a respiration chamber for indirect calorimetric measurements to calculate heat production, fat (FOX) and carbohydrate oxidation (COX), as well as respiratory quotient. Blood was sampled on d 1 before first colostrum intake and on d 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10 before morning feeding, to measure plasma concentrations of immunoglobulins, metabolites, and hormones. Additional postprandial blood samples were taken on d 1 and 9 at 30, 60, 120, 240, and 420 min after milk feeding. Liver samples were collected on d 10 of life to determine gene expression related to energy metabolism. Formula-fed calves showed lower plasma concentrations of total protein, immunoglobulins, haptoglobin, leptin, adiponectin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein (IGFBP)-4 during the whole study but temporarily higher plasma concentrations of urea, insulin, glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on the first day after feeding, compared with concentrations in COL. The temporary increase in glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on d 1 reversed on d 2 or 3, showing higher concentrations in COL than in FOR calves. In FOR, IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were lower on d 3 than in COL. Interestingly, FOR calves had higher heat production during respiratory measurements on d 2 and higher body temperature on d 2, 3, and 5 than those of COL. The hepatic mRNA abundance of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was higher in FOR than in COL. Our results indicate that first milk feeding after birth influenced whole-body energy expenditure but not FOX and COX in neonatal calves, and the absorption of colostral leptin and adiponectin might affect insulin sensitivity on d 1 of life.","e045d8ef8b4339421644d0c0faf831c271a14abd","True","Journal of Dairy Science","first|10|first|Male Holstein|18|COL|9|9|first|2|3|2|7|FOX|1|2|3|7|8|9|10|1|9|30|60|120|240|420|10|Formula|IGF|the first day|COL|1|2|3|COL|IGF|IGFBP-2|3|COL|2|2|3|5|COL|FOR|COL|first|FOX|COX|1","els-covid","","","","ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-04-30","","10.3168/jds.2019-17708","custom_license"

Despite their essential role, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the syncytins' function. We report here the X-ray structures of the syn1 and syn2 transmembrane subunit ectodomains, featuring a 6-helix bundle (6HB) typical of the post-fusion state of gamma-retrovirus and filovirus fusion proteins. Contrary to the filoviruses, for which the fusion glycoprotein was crystallized both in the post-fusion and in the spring-loaded pre-fusion form, the highly unstable nature of the syncytins' prefusion form has precluded structural studies. We undertook a proline-scanning approach searching for regions in the syn1 6HB central helix that tolerate the introduction of helix-breaker residues and still fold correctly in the pre-fusion form. We found that there is indeed such a region, located two α-helical turns downstream a stutter in the central coiled-coil helix - precisely where the breaks of the spring-loaded helix of the filoviruses map. These mutants were fusion-inactive as they cannot form the 6HB, similar to the “SOSIP” mutant of HIV Env that allowed the high-resolution structural characterization of its labile pre-fusion form. These results now open a new window of opportunity to engineer more stable variants of the elusive pre-fusion trimer of the syncytins and other gamma-retroviruses envelope proteins for structural characterization.","adf19a9b6146fd075d668ad7a41b4f9e6dc48a51","True","Journal of Molecular Biology","syncytin-2|syn1|6-helix|syn1|two","els-covid","","","31711961","CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-06","","10.1016/j.jmb.2019.10.020","custom_license"

It has become a major health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries, especially in regions of conflict and political instability. Currently, there are only limited drug treatments and no available licensed vaccine; thus, the need for more therapeutic interventions remains urgent. Previously, a DNA vaccine encoding a 15 kDa sandfly (Phlebotomus papatasi) salivary protein (PpSP15) and recombinant nonpathogenic Leishmania tarentolae secreting PpSP15 have been shown to induce protective immunity against Leishmania major in mice, demonstrating that PpSP15 is a promising vaccine candidate. In this study, we developed a fermentation process in yeast with a yield of ~1g PpSP15/L and a scalable purification process consisting of only 2 chromatographic purification steps with high binding capacity for PpSP15, suggesting that PpSP15 can be produced economically. The biophysical/biochemical analysis of the purified PpSP15 indicated that the protein was of high purity (>97%) and conformationally stable between pH 4.4 and 9.0. More importantly, the recombinant protein had a defined structure similar to that of the related PdSP15 from Phlebotomus duboscqi, implying the suitability of the yeast expression system for producing a correctly folded PpSP15.","e61c31e3d33e5a165b698a1a89a8ca7781d7e805","True","Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences","Leishmania|15|Phlebotomus|Leishmania|Leishmania|PpSP15|PpSP15/L|only 2|97%|9.0|PdSP15|Phlebotomus|PpSP15","els-covid","","","","GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-15","","10.1016/j.xphs.2020.02.004","custom_license"

A key determinant of ability to control the outbreak is the relative timing of infectiousness and symptom onset. We provide a method for identifying this relationship with high accuracy based on data from simulated household-stratified symptom-onset data. Further, this can be achieved with observations taken on only a few specific days, chosen optimally, within each household. The information provided by this method may inform decision making processes for outbreak response. An accurate and computationally-efficient heuristic for determining the optimal surveillance scheme is introduced.

Efforts to recover donor lungs with reversible injuries using ex vivo perfusion systems are limited to <24 hours of support. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of extending normothermic extracorporeal lung support to 4 days using cross-circulation with conscious swine. Methods A swine behavioral training program and custom enclosure were developed to enable multiday cross-circulation between extracorporeal lungs and recipient swine. Lungs were ventilated and perfused in a normothermic chamber for 4 days. Longitudinal analyses of extracorporeal lungs (ie, functional assessments, multiscale imaging, cytokine quantification, and cellular assays) and recipient swine (eg, vital signs and blood and tissue analyses) were performed. Results Throughout 4 days of normothermic support, extracorporeal lung function was maintained (arterial oxygen tension/inspired oxygen fraction >400 mm Hg; compliance >20 mL/cm H2O), and recipient swine were hemodynamically stable (lactate <3 mmol/L; pH, 7.42 ± 0.05). Radiography revealed well-aerated lower lobes and consolidation in upper lobes of extracorporeal lungs, and bronchoscopy showed healthy airways without edema or secretions. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL) 4, IL-6, and IL-10 levels increased less than 6-fold, whereas interferon gamma, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels decreased from baseline to day 4. Histologic evaluations confirmed an intact blood–gas barrier and outstanding preservation of airway and alveolar architecture. Cellular viability and metabolism in extracorporeal lungs were confirmed after 4 days. Conclusions We demonstrate feasibility of normothermic maintenance of extracorporeal lungs for 4 days by cross-circulation with conscious swine. Cross-circulation approaches could support the recovery of damaged lungs and enable organ bioengineering to improve transplant outcomes.","1a92bf7defda97e4859f8b4869012db33da973a5","True","The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery","24 hours|4 days|4 days|4 days|400|mm Hg|20 mL/cm|7.42|IL|4|IL-6|IL-10|less than 6-fold|IL-1α|IL-1ra|IL-2|day 4|4 days|4 days","els-covid","","","31761338","TIME|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|PERSON|DATE|DATE|DATE","Elsevier","2020-04-30","","10.1016/j.jtcvs.2019.09.121","custom_license"

After eight years of a “diplomatic truce” under President Ma Ying-jeou, China re-started its multi-pronged strategy to pressure Taiwan into eventual unification, and one of the key tactics is to poach all of Taiwan's now-15 remaining diplomatic allies to eliminate its international legitimacy.

This turn in part reflects the limited effectiveness of Beijing's much-increased hard power and its never-formidable and now-reduced soft power as means to achieve China's ends with the United States. China's political warfare and uses of sharp power pursue both direct influence on U.S. policy and indirect impact through affecting American attitudes toward China and China-related issues. China's efforts range across many sectors—including business, culture, media, education, and more—and they have prompted reactions and countermeasures. In China's view, the United States has long been engaged in something like political warfare or sharp power undertakings targeting China. If, or as, U.S.-China relations continue to become more adversarial, political warfare, uses of sharp power, and measures to counter them are likely to increase.","68968ad433649fc71ca4146f343ff2d0206c7816","True","Orbis","The People's Republic of China|U.S.|China|Beijing|China|the United States|China|U.S.|American|China|China|China|China|the United States|China|U.S","els-covid","","","","GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-04","","10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.004","custom_license"
"Hui, Victoria Tin-bor","Beijing's Hard and Soft Repression in Hong Kong","Abstract Hong Kong's new Police Commissioner Chris Tang announced in Beijing on December 7, 2019, that he would use “both hard and soft approaches” to end the anti-government protests. This article argues that such “approaches” amount to physical and non-physical repression—hard power, but employed by Hong Kong, rather than mainland, forces, combined with sharp power exercised by both Beijing and the local authorities. These measures are responses to the limits on what Beijing can do under the “one country, two systems” model. As Beijing cannot send the People's Liberation Army (PLA), it has subverted Hong Kong's once-respected civilian police force to act like the mainland's public security. And as Hong Kong's judiciary is relatively autonomous and many of the arrested would not be convicted or sentenced, the police have resorted to a decapacitation campaign to inflict direct violence on protesters. Moreover, as the city's freedom has allowed the public to support protesters in various ways, Beijing has launched a program of dismissal of pro-democracy individuals in both public and private sectors. To zoom in on Beijing's hard and soft repression, this article examines in closer detail the other “frontliners” at protest sites who provide professional services vital to the sustainability of protests: medics, firefighters, lawyers, journalists, and educators.","68c0bb1989b6ca2b38da32a0d992027db39f80bc","True","Orbis","Hong Kong's|Chris Tang|Beijing|December 7, 2019|Hong Kong|Beijing|Beijing|one|two|Beijing|the People's Liberation Army|PLA|Hong Kong's|Hong Kong's|Beijing|Beijing","els-covid","","","","GPE|PERSON|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-04","","10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.010","custom_license"

About 1-day-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens inoculated with CK/CH/JS/TAHY at 105.5 EID50 exhibited clinical signs including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and tracheal vocalization accompanied by depression with 84% mortality and 100% morbidity. The kidneys of dead birds were swollen and pale and exhibited severe urate deposition. Histopathological examination revealed kidney hemorrhages, multifocal necrosis of the renal tubules and trachea with cilia loss, sloughing of epithelial cells, and edema of the lamina propria. IBV-specific antibodies appeared at 10 D post-infection. Chickens vaccinated with a CK/CH/JS/TAHY oil-emulsion vaccine showed 26.7% morbidity and 3% mortality indicating a protective effect. In conclusion, the IBV strain is a virulent avian IBV and that exhibited severe pathogenicity in chickens and is a vaccine candidate to prevent infection by Chinese QX-like nephropathogenic IBV strains.","9ec51cd6ce837abb8eb9bede87b12bf6ea05ed4d","True","Poultry Science","IBV|IBV|CK/CH|JS|TAHY|S1|CK/CH|JS|TAHY|QX|S1|1,620|540|HRRR|1-day-old|White Leghorn|CK/CH/JS/TAHY|105.5|EID50|84%|100%|10|JS|TAHY|26.7%|3%|IBV|IBV|Chinese QX|IBV","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.3382/ps/pez568","custom_license"

Hypericin (HY) is an excellent compound that has been investigated in antiviral, antineoplastic, and antidepressant. To investigate the inhibition effect of HY on IBV infection in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells, 3 different experimental designs: pre-treatment of cells prior to IBV infection, direct treatment of IBV-infected cells, and pre-treatment of IBV prior to cell infection were used. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy were performed and virus titer was determined by TCID50. The results revealed that HY had a good anti-IBV effect when HY directly treated the IBV-infected cells, and virus infectivity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, HY inhibited IBV-induced apoptosis in CEK cells, and significantly reduced the mRNA expression levels of Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8, and significantly increased Bcl-2 mRNA expression level in CEK cells. In addition, HY treatment could decrease IBV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in CEK cells. These results suggested that HY showed potential antiviral activities against IBV infection involving the inhibition of apoptosis and ROS generation in CEK cells.","f48acaa9b87ab31e2be26149983fd243c4a9be6f","True","Poultry Science","IBV|Hypericin (HY)|HY on IBV|CEK|3|IBV|IBV|IBV|IFA|TCID50|HY|HY|IBV|HY|IBV|CEK|FasL|JNK|Bax, Caspase 3|CEK|HY|IBV|ROS|CEK|HY|IBV|ROS generation|CEK","els-covid","","","31399732","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.3382/ps/pez465","custom_license"

Previously, it was demonstrated that passive immunization by providing hyperimmune egg yolk through the feed reduces Campylobacter jejuni colonization in broilers. Campylobacteriosis is the most commonly reported bacterial foodborne zoonosis worldwide, and poultry products are the number one origin of these bacteria for human infection. To date, no effective control measures exist to limit Campylobacter colonization in the chicken's intestinal tract. Here, the effect of lyophilization of hyperimmune egg yolk on protection of broilers against C. jejuni was investigated. During an in vivo trial, broiler chickens were prophylactically given feed with lyophilized hyperimmune or non-immunized egg yolk powder starting from day 1 after hatch. At day 11, broilers were inoculated with C. jejuni according to a seeder model. Five days later, all broilers were euthanized and cecal content was examined for C. jejuni colonization. No decrease in C. jejuni colonization was found. The freeze-drying resulted in a 16-fold decrease of the antibody titer in the yolk powder compared to the fresh yolks, presumably caused by structural changes in the antibodies. In conclusion, applying freeze-dried hyperimmune egg yolk failed to protect broilers against C. jejuni colonization, possibly because lyophilization affected the antibodies' functionality.","8e3cac1f7b393c978bed3a60fe5904320d0622a6","True","Poultry Science","Campylobacteriosis|one|C.|day 1|day 11|C.|Five days later|C.|C.|16-fold|C.","els-covid","","","","PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-14","","10.1016/j.psj.2019.11.054","custom_license"
"Ren, Mengting; Han, Zongxi; Zhao, Yan; Sun, Junfeng; Liu, Shengwang; Ma, Deying","Multiple recombination events between field and vaccine strains resulted in the emergence of a novel infectious bronchitis virus with decreased pathogenicity and altered replication capacity","Abstract In this study, we isolated and identified 2 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains from layer chickens soon after vaccination with the Massachusetts–Connecticut bivalent vaccine (Conn) and H120 and 4/91 booster vaccines in China in 2011. The results of cross-virus-neutralization tests and phylogenetic analysis of the S1 subunit of spike gene of these vaccine strains and other reference strains showed that strain LJL/110302 was of GI-19 lineage, whereas LLN/111169 was of the GI-1 lineage of the Conn serotype. Further comparative genomic analysis revealed that LLN/111169, an IBV strain with novel traits, originated from multiple recombination events (at least 3 recombination sites) between GI-19 and the Conn and 4/91 vaccine strains. LLN/111169 was pathogenic to specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. This is of prime importance because while IBV prevention measures worldwide are mainly dependent on modified live vaccine strains, our results showed that recombination between field and vaccine strains has produced a novel pathogenic IBV strain. In addition, LLN/111169 showed relatively broad tissue tropism (trachea, lungs, kidneys, and cecal tonsils) in infected SPF chickens. These results emphasize the importance of IBV surveillance in chicken flocks.","ba49429c98adec7a73861dabdabbf5291cea3cac","True","Poultry Science","2|IBV|Massachusetts|Conn|4/91|China|2011|S1|LJL/110302|GI-19|Conn|IBV|at least 3|between GI-19 and the Conn and 4/91|SPF|IBV|IBV|SPF|IBV","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|NORP|NORP|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-28","","10.1016/j.psj.2019.11.056","custom_license"

In about 10% of infected cats, a potentially lethal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) occurs. Virus transmission is faecal-oral. Mutian® X is a product marketed to treat cats with FIP but is also being used to stop virus shedding, although no clear guidelines exist for its use for this purpose. The aim of this study was to establish the minimum dose and treatment duration required to ensure viral clearance from the faeces of asymptomatic virus-shedding cats. In five multicat households, 29 cats naturally infected with FCoV and actively shedding virus in the faeces were given Mutian X pills. Virus shedding was monitored using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) controlled for faecal inhibitors to ensure sensitivity. Mutian X given orally cleared the virus in 29 cats; although four cats required a repeated course to finally stop virus shedding. A dose of 4 mg/kg q24 h for four days was found to be the optimal treatment protocol: 2 mg/kg cleared only 80% of cats. Post-treatment using a sensitive RT-qPCR test was essential to ensure that virus clearance had been achieved, since failure to clear even one cat can result in re-infection of the others. Records of virus shedding by cats before treatment provided a retrospective control: significantly more cats stopped shedding virus after Mutian X than recovered from infection during the control period (p < .00001). This is the first report of the successful elimination of faecal FCoV shedding in chronically infected cats.","5f74a7116af40761068dd1ba76c243965264a08a","True","Research in Veterinary Science","Feline|FCoV|about 10%|FIP|Mutian|FIP|five|29|FCoV|Mutian|RT|Mutian|29|four|4|four days|2|only 80%|RT|Mutian|first|FCoV","els-covid","","","","DATE|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|NORP|ORDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-19","","10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.02.012","custom_license"

CPEs provide naked eye detection possibility by their superior optical properties however, as concentration of target analytes decrease, trace amounts of nucleic acid typically yield colorimetric responses that are not readily perceivable by naked eye. Herein, we report a pixelated analysis approach for correlating colorimetric responses of CPE with nucleic acid concentrations down to 1 nM, in plasma samples, utilizing a smart phone with an algorithm that can perform analytical testing and data processing. The detection strategy employed relies on conformational transitions between single stranded nucleic acid-cationic CPE duplexes and double stranded nucleic acid-CPE triplexes that yield distinct colorimetric responses for enabling naked eye detection of nucleic acids. Cationic poly[N,N,N-triethyl-3-((4-methylthiophen-3-yl)oxy)propan-1-aminium bromide] is utilized as the CPE reporter deposited on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for nucleic acid assay. A smart phone application is developed to capture and digitize the colorimetric response of the individual pixels of the digital images of CPE on the PVDF membrane, followed by an analysis using the algorithm. The proposed pixelated approach enables precise quantification of nucleic acid assay concentrations, thereby eliminating the margin of error involved in conventional methodologies adopted for interpretation of colorimetric responses, for instance, RGB analysis. The obtained results illustrate that a ubiquitous smart phone could be utilized for point of care colorimetric nucleic acids assays in complex matrices without requiring sophisticated software or instrumentation.","f5e763d2253a378b85985424e5c3e3bc09d35583","True","Talanta","Herein|CPE|1 nM|CPE|N|CPE|PVDF|CPE|PVDF|RGB","els-covid","","","31892020","PERSON|ORG|MONEY|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-01","","10.1016/j.talanta.2019.120581","custom_license"

Spinel thin films with a thickness of approximately 100 nm were obtained from the [(Ni x Mn1- x )0.84Cu0.16]3O4 films annealed at the low temperature of 380 °C for 5 h, which enables their direct integration onto substrates having complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) read-out circuitry. To obtain negative-temperature-coefficient films with reasonable performance through low enough temperature anneal process, Ni content has been systematically varied, and the film microstructure has been found to depend on the relative amount of Ni and Mn. A single phase of cubic spinel structure has been confirmed in the prepared films. The resistivity (ρ) of the annealed films decreases with increasing Mn4+/Mn3+ value due to the hopping mechanism between Mn3+ and Mn4+ cations in octahedral sites of spinel structure. Although the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the annealed films has been decreased slightly with the increase of Ni content, good enough properties of the film (ρ = 61.3 Ω•cm, TCR = −2.950%/K in x = 0.30 film) has been obtained even with the annealing at rather low temperature of 380 °C, thus enabling the direct integration onto substrates having read-out circuitry.

While PDCoV N significantly suppresses PEDV replication, overexpression of TGEV N, like that of PEDV N, increases production of PEDV RNA and virions.

Similar to Miller M6, virulent Purdue and China strain TS, in S gene the JS2012 maintained genetic integrity and the characteristics of the TGEV virulent strains. In vivo, TGEV JS2012 caused 100% mortality in newborn piglets, indicating the strong pathogenicity of this isolate. These results reveal that the JS2012 is a novel natural recombinant TGEV with high virulence. Our findings provide valuable information about genetic diversity and infection mechanism of the coronavirus family.","7d301792a867c9978ec19acd7ed798c856b823e5","True","Virology","TGEV|one|TGEV|JS2012|Jiangsu Province|China|TGEV|JS2012|Purdue|Miller|TGEV|JS2012|Miller|M6|Purdue|Miller|M6|Purdue|China|TS|JS2012|TGEV|TGEV|JS2012|100%|JS2012|TGEV","els-covid","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|GPE|GPE|ORG|PRODUCT|PRODUCT|PERSON|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|PRODUCT|PRODUCT|PERSON|DATE|PRODUCT|GPE|GPE|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|PERCENT|PRODUCT|ORG","Elsevier","2020-06-30","","10.1016/j.virol.2020.03.001","custom_license"

Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is an important cytokine that plays a critical role in the inflammatory and immune responses. Although IL-17 family members have been extensively studied in mammals, our knowledge of the activity of IL-17 proteins in teleosts in response to viral infection is still limited. In this study, the role of IL-17 in GCRV infection and its mechanism were investigated. The expression levels of IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, and IL-17AF3 in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells gradually increased from 6 h after infection with GCRV. The nuclear translocation of p65, which acts in the NF-κB signaling pathway, was also increased by GCRV infection. The overexpression of IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, or IL-17AF3 also promoted the nuclear translocation of p65 and the levels of phospho-IκBα in CIK cells, and reduced the expression of the viral structural protein VP7. An NF-κB signal inhibitor abolished the inhibition of GCRV infection by IL-17 proteins. These results suggested that the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated by the overexpression of IL-17 proteins, resulting in the inhibition of viral infection. In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrated that IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, and IL-17AF3 acted as immune cytokines, exerting an antiviral effect by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway.","388de2b2bf26d85e97af0b86cb1441f017559398","True","Aquaculture","China|GCRV|Interleukin 17|IL-17|IL-17|IL-17|IL-17AF1|IL-17AF2|Ctenopharyngodon|CIK|6|GCRV|NF-κB|GCRV|IL-17AF1|IL-17AF2|CIK|VP7|NF-κB|GCRV|IL-17|NF-κB|IL-17|IL-17AF1|IL-17AF2|NF-κB","els-covid","","","","GPE|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|LOC|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|LOC|QUANTITY|GPE|ORG|LOC","Elsevier","2020-04-15","","10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.734969","custom_license"

The study aimed to explore the associations of multiple climate variables with influenza A (Flu-A) and B virus (Flu-B) transmissions in Shanghai, China. Weekly influenza virus and climate data (mean temperature (MeanT), diurnal temperature range (DTR), relative humidity (RH) and wind velocity (Wv)) were collected between June 2012 and December 2018. Generalized linear models (GLMs), distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs) and regression tree models were developed to assess such associations. MeanT exerted the peaking risk of Flu-A at 1.4 °C (2-weeks’ cumulative relative risk (RR): 14.88, 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.67–23.31) and 25.8 °C (RR: 12.21, 95%CI: 6.64–19.83), Flu-B had the peak at 1.4 °C (RR: 26.44, 95%CI: 11.52–51.86). The highest RR of Flu-A was 23.05 (95%CI: 5.12–88.45) at DTR of 15.8 °C, that of Flu-B was 38.25 (95%CI: 15.82–87.61) at 3.2 °C. RH of 51.5% had the highest RR of Flu-A (9.98, 95%CI: 4.03–26.28) and Flu-B (4.63, 95%CI: 1.95–11.27).

Hence, there is an urgency to understand the response mechanisms of marine organisms to adverse environment. Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in many biological processes, their roles in stress responses still remain unclear. Here, differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified as responses to environmental stresses in the economically important sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus, and their potential roles were explored. Based on a total of 159, 355 and 495 significantly upregulated genes and 230, 518 and 647 significantly downregulated genes identified in the thermal, hypoxic and combination thermal + hypoxic stress treatments, respectively, we constructed DE-lncRNA-mRNA coexpression networks. Among the networks, eight shared pairs were identified from the three treatments, and based on the connectivity degree, MSTRG.27265, MSTRG.19729 and MSTRG.95524 were shown to be crucial lncRNAs. Among all the significantly changed lncRNAs identified by RT-qPCR and sequencing data, binding sites were found in four other lncRNAs (MSTRG.34610, MSTRG.10941, MSTRG.81281 and MSTRG.93731) with Aja-miR-2013-3p, a key miRNA that responds to hypoxia in sea cucumbers. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) was also shown as the possible targeted mRNA of Aja-miR-2013-3p. As indicated by a dual-luciferase reporter assay system, “HIF-1α gene/Aja-miR-2013-3p/MSTRG.34610” network and the “HIF-1α gene/Aja-miR-2013-3p/MSTRG.10941” network may play important roles in sea cucumbers under environmental stresses. Moreover, environmental stress altered the expression of multiple lncRNAs and mRNAs, thus affecting various biological processes in A. japonicus, including immunity, energy metabolism and the cell cycle. At the molecular level, more comprehensive responses were elicited by the combined thermal/hypoxic stress treatment than by individual stresses alone in sea cucumbers. This study lays the groundwork for future research on molecular mechanisms of echinoderm responses to thermal and hypoxic stress in the context of global climate changes.","308b85a5c3d4cad71564cb5f7612c515f393af9d","True","Science of The Total Environment","DE|mRNAs|159|355|495|230|518|647|DE-lncRNA|eight|three|MSTRG.27265, MSTRG.19729|RT-|four|MSTRG.10941|MSTRG.81281|MSTRG.93731|Aja|HIF-1α|Aja|HIF-1α|Aja|HIF-1α|Aja|mRNAs|A.","els-covid","","","31905562","PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|NORP|ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-20","","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136045","custom_license"
"Nag, Rajat; Whyte, Paul; Markey, Bryan K.; O'Flaherty, Vincent; Bolton, Declan; Fenton, Owen; Richards, Karl G.; Cummins, Enda","Ranking hazards pertaining to human health concerns from land application of anaerobic digestate","Abstract Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been identified as one of the cleanest producers of green energy. AD typically uses organic materials as feedstock and, through a series of biological processes, produces methane. Farmyard manure and slurry (FYM&S) are important AD feedstock and are typically mixed with agricultural waste, grass and/or food wastes. The feedstock may contain many different pathogens which can survive the AD process and hence also possibly be present in the final digestate. In this study, a semi-quantitative screening tool was developed to rank pathogens of potential health concern emerging from AD digestate. A scoring system was used to categorise likely inactivation during AD, hazard pathways and finally, severity as determined from reported human mortality rates, number of global human-deaths and infections per 100,000 populations. Five different conditions including mesophilic and thermophilic AD and three different pasteurisation conditions were assessed in terms of specific pathogen inactivation. In addition, a number of scenarios were assessed to consider foodborne incidence data from Ireland and Europe and to investigate the impact of raw FYM&S application (without AD and pasteurisation). A sensitivity analysis revealed that the score for the mortality rate (S3) was the most sensitive parameter (rank coefficient 0.49) to influence the final score S; followed by thermal inactivation score (S1, 0.25) and potential contamination pathways (S2, 0.16). Across all the scenarios considered, the screening tool prioritised Cryptosporidium parvum, Salmonella spp., norovirus, Streptococcus pyogenes, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Mycobacterium spp., Salmonella typhi (followed by S. paratyphi), Clostridium spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter coli as the highest-ranking pathogens of human health concern resulting from AD digestate in Ireland. This tool prioritises potentially harmful pathogens which can emerge from AD digestate and highlights where regulation and intervention may be required.","4f978d584b129046e3f2129353f04d04b987a640","True","Science of The Total Environment","AD|AD|AD|AD|AD|100,000|Five|AD|three|Ireland|Europe|0.49|S1|0.25|0.16|Cryptosporidium|Salmonella|Streptococcus|E.|EPEC|Mycobacterium|Salmonella|S. paratyphi|Clostridium|Listeria|AD|Ireland|AD","els-covid","","","32050363","DATE|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|LOC|MONEY|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|GPE|FAC|ORG|PERSON|DATE|GPE|DATE","Elsevier","2020-03-25","","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136297","custom_license"

Investigating the relation between cardiovascular disease and exposure to a complex mixture of air pollutants requires holistic approaches. We assessed the relationship between exposure to multiple air pollutants and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in a general population sample. We collected data in the Lille MONICA registry (2008–2011) on 3268 incident cases (age range: 35–74). Based on 20 indicators, we derived a composite environmental score (SEnv) for cumulative exposure to air pollution. Poisson regression models were used to analyse associations between CHD rates on one hand and SEnv and each single indicator on the other (considered in tertiles, where T3 is the most contaminated). We adjusted models for age, sex, area-level social deprivation, and neighbourhood spatial structure. The incidence of CHD was a spatially heterogeneous (p=0.006). There was a significant positive association between SEnv and CHD incidence (trend p=0.0151). The relative risks [95%CI] of CHD were 1.08 [0.98–1.18] and 1.16 [1.04–1.29] for the 2nd and 3rd tertile of SEnv exposure. In the single pollutant analysis, PM10, NO2, cadmium, copper, nickel, and palladium were significantly associated with CHD rates. Multiple air pollution was associated with an increased risk of CHD. Single pollutants reflecting road traffic pollution were the most strongly associated with CHD. Our present results are consistent with the literature data on the impact of road traffic on the CHD risk in urban areas.","ae5bdff69c84e77d88e9790626c486bb49e2a4f7","True","Science of The Total Environment","CHD|Lille|2008–2011|3268|35–74|20|SEnv|Poisson|CHD|SEnv|T3|CHD|p=0.006|SEnv|CHD|CHD|1.08|0.98–1.18|1.16|1.04–1.29|the 2nd and 3rd|SEnv|PM10|CHD|CHD|CHD|CHD","els-covid","","","","ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|DATE|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-04-20","","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136608","custom_license"
"Stoffolano, John G.","Chapter Two Fly foregut and transmission of microbes","Abstract Two areas of research that have greatly increased in attention are: dipterans as vectors and the microbes they are capable of vectoring. Because it is the front-end of the fly that first encounters these microbes, this review focuses on the legs, mouthparts, and foregut, which includes the crop as major structures involved in dipteran vectoring ability. The legs and mouthparts are generally involved in mechanical transmission of microbes. However, the crop is involved in more than just mechanical transmission, for it is within the lumen of the crop that microbes are taken up with the meal of the fly, stored, and it is within the lumen that horizontal transmission of bacterial resistance has been demonstrated. In addition to storage of microbes, the crop is also involved in depositing the microbes via a process known as regurgitation. Various aspects of crop regulation are discussed and specific examples of crop involvement with microorganisms are discussed. The importance of biofilm and biofilm formation are presented, as well as, some physical parameters of the crop that might either facilitate or inhibit biofilm formation. Finally, there is a brief discussion of dipteran model systems for studying crop microbe interactions.","0eda17b0f24c49d736476c8bb1e9ae90f186e525","True","Advances in Insect Physiology","Two|first","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|ORDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/bs.aiip.2019.10.001","custom_license"

The Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 and has caused recurrent outbreaks in humans with a fatality rate of 35%. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses that crossed the species barrier using bats/palm civets and dromedary camels, respectively. No specific treatments or vaccines have been approved against any of the six human coronaviruses, highlighting the need to investigate the principles governing viral entry and cross-species transmission as well as to prepare for zoonotic outbreaks which are likely to occur due to the large reservoir of CoVs found in mammals and birds.

It involves the installment of either single ubiquitin (Ub) moieties or one of eight different polyUb linkage types, each giving a distinct cellular outcome. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) reverse Ub signaling by disassembly of one or multiple poly-Ub chain types and their malfunction is often associated with human disease. The Ub system displays significant crosstalk with structurally homologous ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls), including SUMO, Nedd8, and ISG15. This can be seen with the existence of heterogeneous chains made from Ub–Ubl mixtures as well as the proteolytic cross reactivity displayed by several DUBs toward other Ubl systems. In addition, numerous pathogens have been found to encode Ub(l)-ligases and deconjugating enzymes in order to facilitate infection and fight the host immune response. Studying the activity of DUBs and Ubl-specific proteases, both human as well as pathogen-derived, gives fundamental insights into their physiological roles. Activity-based probes (ABPs) have proven to be valuable tools to achieve this, as they report on enzyme activities by making a (often irreversible) covalent complex, rather than on their relative abundance. In this chapter, we explain the potential of ABPs to assess substrate preferences, structural features, and activity of Ub and Ubl deconjugating enzymes. We further demonstrate the practical use of ABPs to (1) characterize the activity of viral proteases toward Ub and Ubls and (2) to gain more insight in the structural determinants of substrate preference of DUBs.","ae0294a3bf36a8f845194ac63d10b1b9d264d5a0","True","Methods in Enzymology","Abstract Protein (|Ub|one|eight|Ub|one|Ub|Ub|Ubls|SUMO|Ub–Ubl|Ubl|Ubl|enzyme|Ub|Ubl|1|Ub|Ubls|2|DUBs","els-covid","","","30850060","ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|FAC|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/bs.mie.2018.12.037","custom_license"
"Pruneda, Jonathan N.; Komander, David","Chapter Fourteen Evaluating enzyme activities and structures of DUBs","Abstract Ubiquitin signaling requires tight control of all aspects of protein ubiquitination, including the timing, locale, extent, and type of modification. Dysregulation of any of these signaling features can lead to severe human disease. One key mode of regulation is through the controlled removal of the ubiquitin signal by dedicated families of proteases, termed deubiquitinases. In light of their key roles in signal regulation, deubiquitinases have become a recent focus for therapeutic intervention as a means to regulate protein abundance. This work and recent discoveries of novel deubiquitinases in humans, viruses, and bacteria, provide the impetus for this chapter on methods for evaluating the activities and structures of deubiquitinases. An array of available deubiquitinase substrates for biochemical characterization are presented and their limitations as standalone tools are discussed.

Objective we investigated the presence of virus and the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, and interferon and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in healthy mucosal tissue of control subjects and the inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of CRS patients, and evaluated whether levels of interferons and ISGs might be affected by CRS-related cytokines and by treatment with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 and TLR7 agonists. Methods The presence of virus in the sinonasal mucosa was evaluated with real-time PCR. The expression of interferons and ISGs in the sinonasal mucosa and in cultured epithelial cells treated with TH1 and TH2 cytokines, macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 and TLR7 agonists were evaluated with real-time PCR and Western blotting. The expression of TLR3 and TLR7 in the sinonasal mucosa were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. Results Respiratory viruses were detected in 15% of samples. Interferons and ISGs are expressed in normal mucosa, but their levels were decreased in patients with CRS. Interferon and ISG levels were upregulated in cells treated with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 agonist, but some were decreased in cytokine-treated cells. TLR3 and TLR7 levels showed no significant difference between normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue. Conclusion These results suggest that decreased levels of interferons and ISGs in patients with CRS might contribute to impairment of the antiviral innate response in inflammatory sinonasal epithelial cells.

The cough reflex can be triggered by nociceptive neurons innervating the lungs, and some bacteria produce neuron-targeting molecules. However, how pulmonary Mtb infection causes cough remains undefined, and whether Mtb produces a neuron-activating, cough-inducing molecule is unknown. Here, we show that an Mtb organic extract activates nociceptive neurons in vitro and identify the Mtb glycolipid sulfolipid-1 (SL-1) as the nociceptive molecule. Mtb organic extracts from mutants lacking SL-1 synthesis cannot activate neurons in vitro or induce cough in a guinea pig model. Finally, Mtb-infected guinea pigs cough in a manner dependent on SL-1 synthesis. Thus, we demonstrate a heretofore unknown molecular mechanism for cough induction by a virulent human pathogen via its production of a complex lipid.","b3528add37d78281040babe78cffa1b58a9c5b62","True","Cell","Summary|Pulmonary|Mycobacterium|Mtb|Mtb|Mtb|Mtb|Mtb|SL-1|Mtb-infected","els-covid","","","","GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-03-05","","10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.026","custom_license"

This review summarizes the latest advances and the main technical issues that determine the success of this technology. The pathway from editing to printing, from engineering the genome to achieving the desired animals, does not always imply an easy, fast and safe journey. When applied in large animals, CRISPR involves time- and cost-consuming projects, and it is mandatory not only to choose the best approach for genome editing, but also for embryo production, zygote microinjection or electroporation, cryopreservation and embryo transfer. The main technical refinements and most frequent questions to improve this disruptive biotechnology in large animals are presented. In addition, we discuss some CRISPR applications to enhance livestock production in the context of a growing global demand of food, in terms of increasing efficiency, reducing the impact of farming on the environment, enhancing pest control, animal welfare and health. The challenge is no longer technical. Controversies and consensus, opportunities and threats, benefits and risks, ethics and science should be reconsidered to enter into the CRISPR era.","579ba516a18b89a67eedcd6a011528c6a9232a87","True","Theriogenology","CRISPR|CRISPR|CRISPR|CRISPR","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-29","","10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.01.063","custom_license"

Although some continuing educational societies aim to improve the level of general knowledge, published scientific facts are still rare, and there are many hypotheses or affirmations that remain unverified or even sometimes dogmatic or empirical. Taking some examples, this article reviews the main causes that may sometimes create difficulties for a veterinary practitioner faced with a dog or a cat suffering from reproductive problems. It could be difficult to orientate the diagnosis or the therapeutic approach, not knowing if what is found in the literature is a scientific certainty or just an unverified affirmation. This problem may result from the fact that there are still physiological processes that remain unclear, but also that some common beliefs are based on old studies that have not been repeated or verified, unverified affirmations, unclear nomenclature, clinical conditions which have not been standardized in the literature, clinical conditions mostly described through case reports, lack of studies on specific topics, areas of small animal reproduction that have been neglected by researchers, contradictory data or even studies that lack objectivity. The growing interest for research in Small Animal Reproduction will probably reduce the gap between unverified beliefs and scientific facts.","019c40eb0b4922ed72f621af542cf1a512dca3d8","True","Theriogenology","Animal Reproduction|Small Animal Reproduction","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-11","","10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.03.014","custom_license"

A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3–4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.","849f0d4e93647e40b3a6f0841ebb2dd6a890a6b7","True","The Lancet","2|over 100|weeks|China|more than 90%|Italy|Italian|daily|Italy|between March 1 and March 11, 2020|between 9% and 11%|Feb 21|Italy|1 more week|30|up to 4000|mid-April, 2020|the next few days|weeks|Italian|Hubei|China|3–4 days|China","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|NORP|DATE|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|NORP|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-13","","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30627-9","custom_license"

The past decade has evidenced the role of intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs)/(IDPRs) in viral and other diseases. In general, (IDPs)/(IDPRs) are considered as dynamic conformational ensembles that devoid of a specific 3D structure, being associated with various important biological phenomena. Viruses utilize IDPs/IDPRs to survive in harsh environments, to evade the host immune system, and to highjack and manipulate host cellular proteins. The role of IDPs/IDPRs in Rotavirus biology and pathogenicity are not assessed so far, therefore, we have designed this study to deeply look at the penetrance of intrinsic disorder in rotavirus proteome consisting 12 proteins encoded by 11 segments of viral genome. Also, for all human rotaviral proteins, we have deciphered molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are disorder based binding sites in proteins. Our study shows the wide spread of intrinsic disorder in several rotavirus proteins, primarily the nonstructural proteins NSP3, NSP4, and NSP5 that are involved in viral replication, translation, viroplasm formation and/or maturation. This study may serve as a primer for understanding the role of IDPs/MoRFs in rotavirus biology, design of alternative therapeutic strategies, and development of disorder-based drugs.","a7bd153b14e8a899deab402b121357a83aa3f822","True","International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","Rotavirus|The past decade|IDPs)/(IDPRs|IDPs)/(IDPRs|Rotavirus|12|11|MoRFs|NSP4","els-covid","","","31739058","ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE","Elsevier","2020-02-01","","10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.09.166","custom_license"

In recent years, a new immunoglobulin-based protein, namely variable domain of new antigen receptor (VNAR) was discovered in sharks. Unlike conventional mAbs, several advantages of VNARs, include small size, better thermostability and peculiar paratope structure have attracted interest of researchers to further explore on it.

Their catalytic activity is carried out using a triad of amino acids, a nucleophile, a base, and an acid. For this superfamily of proteases, we propose the existence of a universal 3D structure comprising 11 amino acids near the catalytic nucleophile and base – Nucleophile-Base Catalytic Zone (NBCZone). The comparison of NBCZones among 169 eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral (chymo)trypsin-like proteases suggested the existence of 15 distinct groups determined by the combination of amino acids located at two “key” structure-functional positions 54T and 55T near the catalytic base His57T. Most eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteases fell into two major groups, [ST]A and TN. Usually, proteases of [ST]A group contain a disulfide bond between cysteines Cys42T and Cys58T of the NBCZone. In contrast, viral proteases were distributed among seven groups, and lack this disulfide bond. Furthermore, only the [ST]A group of eukaryotic proteases contains glycine at position 43T, which is instrumental for activation of these enzymes. In contrast, due to the side chains of residues at position 43T prokaryotic and viral proteases do not have the ability to carry out the structural transition of the eukaryotic zymogen-zyme type.","6160b70c9ba139ee9e4b2accd40954bec9b46f07","True","International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","Chymo)trypsin|11|NBCZones|169|chymo)trypsin|15|two|54|55|His57T.|two|ST]A|TN|ST]A|Cys42|Cys58|seven|ST]A|43|43","els-covid","","","","GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|ORG|NORP|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-06-15","","10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.025","custom_license"

The present study investigated the effect of magnesium (Mg) and vitamin C (VC) supplementation for preventing steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) in a rat experimental model. In SAON rats, 50 mg/kg Mg, or 100 mg/kg VC, or combination, or water control was orally supplemented daily for 2 or 6 weeks respectively. Osteonecrosis was evaluated by histology. Serum Mg, VC, and bone turnover markers were measured. Microfil-perfused samples prepared for angiography and trabecular architecture were evaluated by micro-CT. Primary bone marrow cells were isolated from each group to evaluate their potentials in osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. The mechanisms were tested in vitro. Histological evaluation showed SAON lesions in steroid treated groups. Mg and VC supplementation synergistically reduced the apoptosis of osteocytes and osteoclast number, and increased osteoblast surface. VC supplementation significantly increased the bone formation marker PINP, and the combination significantly decreased the bone resorption marker CTX. TNFα expression and oxidative injury were decreased in bone marrow in Mg/VC/combination group. Mg significantly increased the blood perfusion in proximal tibia and decreased the leakage particles in distal tibia 2 weeks after SAON induction. VC significantly elevated the osteoblast differentiation potential of marrow cells and improved the trabecular architecture. The combination supplementation significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation potential of marrow cells. In vitro study showed promoting osteoblast differentiation effect of VC, and anti-inflammation and promoting angiogenesis effect of Mg with underlying mechanisms. Mg and VC supplementation could synergistically alleviate SAON in rats, indicating great translational potentials of metallic minerals for preventing SAON.","79db3ad22434b309c81d5495d0f9399722593181","True","Biomaterials","Magnesium|VC|SAON|SAON|50|100 mg/kg|VC|daily|2|6 weeks|Serum Mg|VC|SAON|VC|VC|CTX|Mg/VC/|2 weeks|SAON|VC|VC|VC|SAON|SAON","els-covid","","","32045781","PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-04-30","","10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.119828","custom_license"

Here, we cloned the duck KPNA4 (duKPNA4) gene and analyzed its involvement in type I IFN expression as well as antiviral response against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The full-length duKPNA4 gene encoded a 520-amino acid protein that shared 97.3–98.7% sequence similarity with its orthologues in chickens, humans and mice. The duKPNA4 was extensively expressed in various duck tissues at the mRNA level. Analysis of the subcellular localization of duKPNA4 by immunofluorescence assays indicated that the duKPNA4 was primarily distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in primary duck embryonic fibroblasts (DEFs). However, it translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to poly(I:C) stimulation or JEV infection. The duKPNA4 interacted with duck IFN regulatory factor 7 and facilitated its nuclear translocation, thereby up-regulating the expression of IFN-α and IFN-β in DEFs in the presence of poly(I:C) stimulation. Exogenous expression of duKPNA4 significantly elevated the expression of IFN-α and IFN-β induced by JEV infection and inhibited JEV replication in DEFs. These data demonstrate the importance of duKPNA4 in type I IFN signaling as well as the antiviral response against JEV replication.","69f5f00611a1f514460d481a788de0694c9f7dd4","True","Developmental & Comparative Immunology","KPNA4|KPNA4|Japanese|520-amino|97.3–98.7%|7|IFN-α|poly(I|IFN-α","els-covid","","","31697956","ORG|PRODUCT|NORP|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.dci.2019.103535","custom_license"

We combined molecular and serological assays to investigate infections by viral pathogens (Canine parvovirus (CPV), Canine distemper virus (CDV) and Canine coronavirus (CCoV)) in Portuguese carnivores (Canis lupus, Vulpes vulpes, Lutra lutra, Martes foina, M. martes, Meles meles, and Genetta genetta) over a period of 16 years. Additionally we explored spatio-temporal patterns of virus occurrence in Canis lupus. Our study identified CPV DNA in all carnivore species with an overall prevalence of 91.9 %. CPV was detected in all sampled years and seasons in Canis lupus, supporting its enzootic nature. CDV RNA was mainly detected in the Canidae family, with viral nucleic acid recorded between 2005 and 2008 with a peak prevalence of 67 % among the wolf population, followed by a sharp decline, suggesting an epizootic behaviour of the virus. Antibodies show that mustelids and viverrids were often exposed to CDV. CCoV was first recorded by molecular methods in wolf samples in 2002, remaining in the wolf populations with marked fluctuations over time. The dual serological and molecular approach provided important epidemiological data on pathogens of wild carnivores in Portugal.

These strategies now include germline-targeting, lineage-based, and structure-guided immunogen design. This narrative review outlines the historical context of HIV vaccinology and subsequently highlights the scientific discoveries during the last 6 years that promise to propel the field forward. Methods We conducted a search of 2 electronic databases, PubMed and EMBASE, for experimental studies that involved new HIV immunogen designs between 2013 and 2019. During the title and abstract reviews, publications were excluded if they were written in language other than English and/or were a letter to the editor, a commentary, or a conference-only presentation. We then used ClinicalTrials.gov to identify completed and ongoing clinical trials using these strategies. Findings The HIV vaccinology field has undergone periods of significant growth during the last 3 decades. Findings elucidated in preclinical studies have revealed the importance of the interaction between the cellular and humoral immune system. As a result, several new rationally designed vaccine strategies have been developed and explored in the last 6 years, including native-like envelope trimers, nanoparticle, and mRNA vaccine design strategies among others. Several of these strategies have shown enough promise in animal models to progress toward first-in-human Phase I clinical trials. Implications Rapid developments in preclinical and early-phase clinical studies suggest that a tolerable and effective HIV vaccine may be on the horizon.","18bad8a83984c5c3eeb80c785d7450890ded7e9d","True","Clinical Therapeutics","HIV-1|the last 30 years|first|the last 6 years|2|PubMed|EMBASE|between 2013 and 2019|English|ClinicalTrials.gov|the last 3 decades|the last 6 years|first|Implications Rapid","els-covid","","","","ORG|DATE|ORDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|LANGUAGE|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-05","","10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.01.009","custom_license"

Prior studies have described an association of increased self-reported colds and influenza-like symptoms with low ventilation but have not combined rigorous characterization of ventilation with assessment of laboratory confirmed infections. We report a study designed to fill this gap. We followed laboratory confirmed ARI rates and measured CO2 concentrations for four months during the winter-spring of 2018 in two campus residence halls: (1) a high ventilation building (HVB) with a dedicated outdoor air system that supplies 100% of outside air to each dormitory room, and (2) a low ventilation building (LVB) that relies on infiltration as ventilation. We enrolled 11 volunteers for a total of 522 person-days in the HVB and 109 volunteers for 6069 person-days in the LVB, and tested upper-respiratory swabs from symptomatic cases and their close contacts for the presence of 44 pathogens using a molecular assay. We observed one ARI case in the HVB (0.70/person-year) and 47 in the LVB (2.83/person-year). Simultaneously, 154 CO2 sensors distributed primarily in the dormitory rooms collected 668,390 useful data points from over 1 million recorded data points. Average and standard deviation of CO2 concentrations were 1230 ppm and 408 ppm in the HVB, and 1492 ppm and 837 ppm in the LVB, respectively. Importantly, this study developed and calibrated multi-zone models for the HVB with 229 zones and 983 airflow paths, and for the LVB with 529 zones and 1836 airflow paths by using a subset of CO2 data for model calibration. The models were used to calculate ventilation rates in the two buildings and potential for viral aerosol migration between rooms in the LVB. With doors and windows closed, the average ventilation rate was 12 L/s in the HVB dormitory rooms and 4 L/s in the LVB dormitory rooms. As a result, residents had on average 6.6 L/(s person) of outside air in the HVB and 2.3 L/(s person) in the LVB. LVB rooms located at the leeward side of the building had smaller average ventilation rates, as well as a somewhat higher ARI incidence rate and average CO2 concentrations when compared to those values in the rooms located at the windward side of the building. Average ventilation rates in twenty LVB dormitory rooms increased from 2.3 L/s to 7.5 L/s by opening windows, 3.6 L/s by opening doors, and 8.8 L/s by opening both windows and doors. Therefore, opening both windows and doors in the LVB dormitory rooms can increase ventilation rates to the levels comparable to those in the HVB. But it can also have a negative effect on thermal comfort due to low outdoor temperatures.

"Xie, Gang; Qian, Yatong; Wang, Shouyang","A decomposition-ensemble approach for tourism forecasting","Abstract With the frequent occurrence of irregular events in recent years, the tourism industry in some areas, such as Hong Kong, has suffered great volatility. To enhance the predictive accuracy of tourism demand forecasting, a decomposition-ensemble approach is developed based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, data characteristic analysis, and the Elman's neural network model. Using Hong Kong tourism demand as an empirical case, this study firstly investigates how data characteristic analysis is used in a decomposition-ensemble approach. The empirical results show that the proposed model outperforms other models in both point and interval forecasts for different prediction horizons, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for forecasting tourism demand, especially for time series with complexity.","cfd000444a29f11bd63058a1097ea26098f82106","True","Annals of Tourism Research","recent years|Hong Kong|Elman|Hong Kong","els-covid","","","","DATE|GPE|PERSON|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.annals.2020.102891","custom_license"
"Criscitiello, Michael F.; Kraev, Igor; Lange, Sigrun","Deiminated proteins in extracellular vesicles and serum of llama (Lama glama)—Novel insights into camelid immunity","Abstract Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are phylogenetically conserved calcium-dependent enzymes which post-translationally convert arginine into citrulline in target proteins in an irreversible manner, causing functional and structural changes in target proteins. Protein deimination causes generation of neo-epitopes, affects gene regulation and also allows for protein moonlighting. Furthermore, PADs have been found to be a phylogenetically conserved regulator for extracellular vesicle (EVs) release. EVs are found in most body fluids and participate in cellular communication via transfer of cargo proteins and genetic material. In this study, post-translationally deiminated proteins in serum and serum-EVs are described for the first time in camelids, using the llama (Lama glama L. 1758) as a model animal. We report a poly-dispersed population of llama serum EVs, positive for phylogenetically conserved EV-specific markers and characterised by TEM. In serum, 103 deiminated proteins were overall identified, including key immune and metabolic mediators including complement components, immunoglobulin-based nanobodies, adiponectin and heat shock proteins. In serum, 60 deiminated proteins were identified that were not in EVs, and 25 deiminated proteins were found to be unique to EVs, with 43 shared deiminated protein hits between both serum and EVs. Deiminated histone H3, a marker of neutrophil extracellular trap formation, was also detected in llama serum. PAD homologues were identified in llama serum by Western blotting, via cross reaction with human PAD antibodies, and detected at an expected 70 kDa size. This is the first report of deiminated proteins in serum and EVs of a camelid species, highlighting a hitherto unrecognized post-translational modification in key immune and metabolic proteins in camelids, which may be translatable to and inform a range of human metabolic and inflammatory pathologies.","b90c0ff9f6c2d16eed507a2ff051f6f27fec1006","True","Molecular Immunology","PADs|PADs|first|L. 1758|TEM|103|60|25|43|H3|neutrophil|PAD|Western|PAD|70|first","els-covid","","","31733447","ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|ORDINAL","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.molimm.2019.10.017","custom_license"

Here we describe for the first time, the identification and characterization of type I IFNs of dromedary camel, which are the most important cytokines in the innate host immune response against viruses. We cloned camel IFN-α coding sequences and identified a total of eleven subtypes. The canonical IFN-α subtype designated as IFN-α1 contained a 555-bp Open Reading Frame encoding a protein of 184 amino acids. Recombinant IFN-α1 protein was produced in E. coli and purified from inclusion bodies. Recombinant camel IFN-α1 induced the mRNA expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in camel kidney cells. The purified protein also showed potent in-vitro antiviral activity against Camelpox Virus in kidney cells. The identified camel IFN-α protein and the subtypes will facilitate a better understanding of the host immune response to viral infections in camel and the development of potential antiviral biologicals for zoonotic diseases for which camel act as a reservoir.","d9c768e755cd6c50a04bf1031620531681b87453","True","Molecular Immunology","Abstract Investigations|first|IFN-α|eleven|IFN-α|184|IFN-α","els-covid","","","32014632","ORG|ORDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.molimm.2020.01.020","custom_license"
"Huang, Fanyu; Magnin, Chloe; Brouqui, Philippe","Ingestible sensors correlate closely with peripheral temperature measurements in febrile patients","Summary Backgrounds Reliable non-invasive methods for measuring body temperature are essential for the diagnosis and monitoring of infectious disease. Methods This study used Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and the Bland- Altman plot to analyse the agreement between temperature measurements using an ingestible capsule sensor, a skin sensor and two non-invasive peripheral temperature measurements (axillary and infrared non-contact), collected from a population of febrile patient admitted for infectious disease. Results Of the 77 febrile patients screened, 26 patients were enrolled. The ICC between axillary temperature measurements (Taxi) vs. non-contact measurements (Tno-c) were 0.34 [−0.18; 0.63], 0.87 [0.55; 0.94] between Taxi vs. ingestible capsule measurements (Tcap) and 0.12 [−0.09; 0.37] between Taxi vs. Tetac. The mean difference between Taxi vs Tno-c was −1.18 °C with limits of agreement (LoA) from −2.96 to 0.58 °C. The mean difference between Taxi vs Tcap was 0.48 °C, with LoA from −0.60 to 1.56 °C. The mean difference between Taxi vs Tetac was −4.23 °C with LoA from −7.22 to −1.23 °C. Conclusions Ingestible capsule measurements are reliable enough to adequately estimate the core body temperature in clinical practice.

Methods We compare outcomes in two consecutive cohorts of allo-HCT recipients with CARV infections. The retrospective cohort included 63 allo-HCT recipients with 108 CARV infections from January 2013 to April 2016 who were screened and managed following standard clinical practice based on influenza and respiratory syncytial virus rapid antigen detection methods. The prospective cohort was comprised of 144 consecutive recipients with 297 CARV episodes included in a prospective interventional clinical surveillance program (ProClinCarvSur-P) based on syndromic multiplex PCR as first-line test from May 2016 to December 2018 at a single transplant center. Results CARV infections in the retrospective cohort showed more severe clinical features at the time of diagnosis compared to the prospective cohort (fever 83% vs. 57%, hospital admission 69% vs. 28% and lower respiratory tract 58% vs. 31%, respectively, p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons). Antiviral therapy was more commonly prescribed in the prospective cohort (69 vs. 43 treated CARV episodes), particularly at the upper respiratory tract disease stage (34 vs. 12 treated CARV episodes).

A(H7N9) virus-specific antibody responses were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralization (NT) assays. A random intercept model was used to fit a curve to HAI antibody responses over time. HAI antibody responses were compared by clinical severity. Results Of 67 patients with A(H7N9) virus infection, HAI antibody titers reached 40 on average 11 days after illness onset and peaked at a titer of 290 after three months, and average titers of ≥80 and ≥40 were present until 11 months and 22 months respectively.

Materials and methods A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed. Results Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1 °C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis. Conclusion CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved.

Numerous investigations have been focused on the effects of DPP4is on glucose homeostasis. However, there are limited evidences demonstrating their Potential modulatory functions in the immune system. DPP4, originally known as the lymphocyte cell surface protein CD26, is widely expressed in many types of immune cells including CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages; and regulate the functions of these cells. In addition, DPP4 is capable of modulating plenty of cytokines, chemokines and peptide hormones. Accordingly, DPP4/CD26 is speculated to be involved in various immune/inflammatory diseases and DPP4is may become a new drug class applied in these diseases. This review focuses on the regulatory effects of DPP4is on immune functions and their possible underlying mechanisms.

Additionally, favipiravir is being stockpiled for 2 million people as a countermeasure for novel influenza strains. This drug functions as a chain terminator at the site of incorporation of the viral RNA and reduces the viral load. Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza infection model, while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals. Thus, favipiravir contributes to curing animals with lethal infection. In addition to influenza, favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for treatment of human infection with life-threatening Ebola virus, Lassa virus, rabies, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. The best feature of favipiravir as an antiviral agent is the apparent lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant viruses. Favipiravir alone maintains its therapeutic efficacy from the first to the last patient in an influenza pandemic or an epidemic lethal RNA virus infection. Favipiravir is expected to be an important therapeutic agent for severe influenza, the next pandemic influenza strain, and other severe RNA virus infections for which standard treatments are not available.","0329e0f2e3b8ab0eabe2afe0e5214cc88c61080e","True","Pharmacology & Therapeutics","Japan|2 million|RNA|RNA|Lassa|first|RNA|RNA","els-covid","","","","GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-22","","10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107512","custom_license"

In recent years, several investigators developed protective antibodies which could be used as prophylaxis in prospective human epidemics. In the current study, eight human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with neutralizing and non-neutralizing capabilities, directed against different epitopes of the MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (MERS-S) protein, were investigated with regard to their ability to immunohistochemically detect respective epitopes on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) nasal tissue sections of MERS-CoV experimentally infected alpacas. The most intense immunoreaction was detected using a neutralizing antibody directed against the receptor binding domain S1B of the MERS-S protein, which produced an immunosignal in the cytoplasm of ciliated respiratory epithelium and along the apical membranous region. A similar staining was obtained by two other mAbs which recognize the sialic acid-binding domain and the ectodomain of the membrane fusion subunit S2, respectively. Five mAbs lacked immunoreactivity for MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE tissue, even though they belong, at least in part, to the same epitope group. In summary, three tested human mAbs demonstrated capacity for detection of MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE samples and may be implemented in double or triple immunohistochemical methods.","d5036583ad77c21548cff21d909e342a7b059ee9","True","Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","Middle East|one third|recent years|eight|mAbs|CoV|CoV|S1B|MERS-S|two|mAbs|Five|mAbs|CoV|three|mAbs|CoV","els-covid","","","31526954","LOC|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.vetimm.2019.109939","custom_license"

It presents with a barky cough, stridor and hoarseness occurring secondary to inflammation of the subglottis and larynx. The clinical course of croup is well-described, however atypical presentations pose a diagnostic and management challenge. Objectives This case report and systematic review aims to synthesize the published literature on the definition, diagnosis and treatment of atypical croup. Study selection Peer-reviewed journal publications in Ovid MEDLINE® and EMBASE from inception to January 1, 2019 in English, focusing on pediatric patients (<18 years of age) with diagnoses of atypical croup. Data extraction Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results Twelve studies involving 670 patients ranging from 6 months to 11 years of age presenting with atypical croup were selected. A variety of definitions of atypical croup were identified based on recurrence, duration of symptoms, severity, and etiology. Data on the incidence of atypical croup, the overall rates of intubation and tracheostomy, and patient characteristics leading to definitive airway management were not clearly characterized. Limitations All studies were case series, case reports or retrospective chart reviews. Conclusions Atypical croup is a poorly defined clinical entity that is used to describe recurrent, refractory, or croup-like illness that follows an uncharacteristic natural history. Our case presentation and accompanying literature review highlights the variable, but limited, information available on the diagnosis of atypical croup.

To create a biologically meaningful diagnosis, attention should be dedicated to various biotic factors and not only of the diagnostic assay. Included among the important factors are, (a) the sample examined and the sampling strategy, (b) the outcomes of the pathogen amplification ex vivo, (c) the sampling time and its reflection on the disease diagnosis, (d) the impact of simultaneous multiple virus-infections regarding the ability to demonstrate all pathogens and inter- and intra-interactions between the pathogens. A concerted consideration of the relevant factors and the use of advanced molecular diagnostic assay would yield biologically significant diagnosis in real-time that would beneficiate the poultry industry.","93d358a468debfa1def4619cdc38f3e2b08e5e61","True","Journal of Virological Methods","4|Marek","els-covid","","","31351169","CARDINAL|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.113708","custom_license"

Vaccine control strategies for this virus are only effective when designed around the currently circulating serotypes. It is essential to not only rapidly detect IBV but also to identify the type of virus causing disease. Six TaqMan™-based quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays (Universal, Ark, Mass, DE/GA98, GA07, GA08) were developed and examined the sensitivity and specificity for each assay. Assays were developed targeting the hypervariable region in the S1 gene subunit. The analytical sensitivity of TaqMan™-based quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays (qRT-PCR) assays was evaluated using synthetic DNA standards that were identical with the target sequence and specificity was further validated using clinical and biological specimens. All developed assays performed equivalently when using synthetic DNA templates as standard material, as it achieved linearity over a 5 log10 dynamic range with a reproducible limit of detection of ≤10 target copies per reaction, with high calculated amplification efficiencies ranging between 90%–115%. Further validation of specificity using clinical and biological specimens was also successful.","d742322e47773a6a83306f2485b0448579383a7e","True","Journal of Virological Methods","IB|IBV|IBV|Six|™|RT-PCR|Universal|Ark|Mass|DE/GA98|GA07|GA08|S1|TaqMan™|RT-PCR|5|between 90%–115%","els-covid","","","31712094","GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.113773","custom_license"

In a recent study, the genome comparison of an IBV QX vaccine and its progenitor field strain led to the identification of vaccine markers. Here we developed a simplex SYBRgreen RT-qPCR assay for differentiation between QX-like field and vaccine strains and a multiplex SYBRgreen RT-qPCR assay for IBV genotyping with melting curve analysis, as each virus produced distinct and reliable melting peaks.

The mucosal immune system in the gut must eliminate potential pathogens while maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship with the commensal microbiota. Antibodies derived from the secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) class, act as the first line of antigen-specific immunity in the gut by recognizing both pathogens and commensals. Therefore, the measurement of SIgA levels is an important index in evaluating PEDV infections and immune status. A simple and rapid method for the detection of PEDV-specific SIgA using an immunochromatographic test strip has been developed; incorporating a colloidal gold-labeled anti-SIgA secretory component (SC) mAb probe for the detection of anti-PEDV-specific SIgA in swine. On the strip, a gold-labeled anti-SIgA SC mAb was applied to a conjugate pad; purified PEDV particles and goat anti-mouse antibodies were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane to form the test and control lines, respectively. Results showed that the immunochromatographic test strip had high sensitivity and specificity. When compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, kappa value suggesting that the strip could be used to detect PEDV specific SIgA in colostrum samples. Furthermore, the strip assay is rapid and easy to perform with no requirement for professional-level skills or equipment. We found that the immunochromatographic test strip was a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method for the identification of PEDV specific SIgA, indicating its suitability for epidemiological surveillance as well as vaccine immunity when studying PEDV.","8f10bc88985c19907abdb4bfc817bc3e6e25fe52","True","Journal of Virological Methods","first|SIgA|SIgA|SC|mAb|anti|SIgA|SC mAb|enzyme|PEDV|SIgA|PEDV","els-covid","","","","ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|ORDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-12","","10.1016/j.jviromet.2020.113855","custom_license"

Here, A9, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) of the tyrphostin class, is identified as a robust inhibitor of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection in cell-based assays. Moreover, A9 exhibited potent antiviral activity against the replication of various CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). We further performed a comparative phosphoproteomic analysis to investigate the mechanism of action of A9 against TGEV infection in vitro. We specifically identified p38 and JNK1, which are the downstream molecules of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) required for efficient TGEV replication, as A9 targets through plaque assays, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays. p38 and JNK1 inhibitors and RNA interference further showed that the inhibitory activity of A9 against TGEV infection was mainly mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. All these findings indicated that the RTKI A9 directly inhibits TGEV replication and that its inhibitory activity against TGEV replication mainly occurs by targeting p38, which provides vital clues to the design of novel drugs against CoVs.","44ce728e9777a6644404a15f6945116b189f3c17","True","Antiviral Research","RTKI|TGEV|TGEV|TGEV|RNA|TGEV|MAPK|RTKI|TGEV|TGEV","els-covid","","","31751591","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104651","custom_license"

Viral nucleocapsid proteins are inevitable for genome encapsidation and replication. Here we demonstrate the interaction between the N protein of HCoV-229E and cyclophilin A, not cyclophilin B. Cyclophilin inhibitors abolish this interaction. Upon infection, cyclophilin A stays evenly distributed throughout the cell, whereas cyclophilin B concentrates at ER-bleb-like structures.

Thus, non-immunosuppressive CsA derivatives effectively inhibit HCoV-229E replication suggesting them as possible candidates for the treatment of HCoV infection.

It was once a major epidemic in South America and puts millions of people in Argentina at risk. Here, we aimed to develop horse antibodies or antibody fragments against JUNV. Before preparing the horse antibodies, a strategy to efficiently generate horse antisera was established based on comparisons among immunogens and immunization methods in both mice and horses. Antisera against JUNV were finally obtained by vaccinating horses with vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing JUNV GP. The horse antibodies IgG and F(ab’)2 were subsequently demonstrated to effectively neutralize vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing JUNV GP and to show some cross-neutralization against pathogenic New World arenaviruses. Further research revealed that Asp123 on GP1 is an important site for the binding of antibodies targeting mainly JUNV GP1 for neutralization. Collectively, this study presents an efficient strategy to develop horse antisera against JUNV and provides GP1-specific horse antibodies as potential therapeutics for AHF.","49f2e6414df9f612930f953e06af3aa1024742d7","True","Antiviral Research","Argentine|AHF|~30%|JUNV|South America|millions|Argentina|JUNV|Antisera|JUNV|JUNV|IgG|JUNV|New World|GP1|JUNV|JUNV|AHF","els-covid","","","31760108","NORP|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|LOC|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104666","custom_license"
"Clasman, Jozlyn R.; Everett, Renata K.; Srinivasan, Karthik; Mesecar, Andrew D.","Decoupling deISGylating and deubiquitinating activities of the MERS virus papain-like protease","Abstract Coronavirus papain-like proteases (PLPs or PLpro), such as the one encoded in the genome of the infectious Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus, have multiple enzymatic activities that promote viral infection. PLpro acts as a protease and processes the large coronavirus polyprotein for virus replication. PLpro also functions as both a deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating (deISG) enzyme and removes ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins. Both DUB and deISG activities are implicated in suppressing innate immune responses; however, the precise role of each activity in this process is still unclear due in part to the difficulties in separating each activity. In this study, we determine the first structure of MERS PLpro in complex with the full-length human ISG15 to a resolution of 2.3 Å. This structure and available structures of MERS PLpro-Ub complexes were used as molecular guides to design PLpro mutants that lack either or both DUB/deISG activities. We tested 13 different PLpro mutants for protease, DUB, and deISG activitites using fluorescence-based assays. Results show that we can selectively modulate DUB activity at amino acid positions 1649 and 1653 while mutation of Val1691 or His1652 of PLpro to a positive charged residue completely impairs both DUB/deISG activities. These mutant enzymes will provide new functional tools for delineating the importance of DUB versus deISG activity in virus-infected cells and may serve as potential candidates for attenuating the MERS virus in vivo for modified vaccine design efforts.","90c0bd799a1e2db115c04aa6fffa55939558027c","True","Antiviral Research","Coronavirus|PLpro|one|PLpro|DUB|deISG|Ub|15|DUB|first|2.3|PLpro|PLpro|DUB|13|PLpro|DUB|DUB|1649|1653|PLpro|DUB|DUB","els-covid","","","31765674","PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104661","custom_license"

Here, we verified the replication ability and pathogenicity of a reporter HCoV-OC43 strain expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc; rOC43-ns2DelRluc) in mice with different genetic backgrounds (C57BL/6 and BALB/c). Additionally, we monitored the spatial and temporal progression of HCoV-OC43 through the central nervous system (CNS) of live BALB/c mice after intranasal or intracerebral inoculation with rOC43-ns2DelRluc. We found that rOC43-ns2DelRluc was fatal to suckling mice after intranasal inoculation, and that viral titers and Rluc expression were detected in the brains and spinal cords of mice infected with rOC43-ns2DelRluc. Moreover, viral replication was initially observed in the brain by non-invasive bioluminescence imaging before the infection spread to the spinal cord of BALB/c mice, consistent with its tropism in the CNS. Furthermore, the Rluc readout correlated with the HCoV replication ability and protein expression, which allowed quantification of antiviral activity in live mice. Additionally, we validated that chloroquine strongly inhibited rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication in vivo. These results provide new insights into the temporal and spatial dissemination of HCoV-OC43 in the CNS, and our methods provide an extremely sensitive platform for evaluating the efficacy of antiviral therapies to treat neuroinvasive HCoVs in live mice.","1291897d17fac6a0658ddca49931aca2b7d2eb65","True","Antiviral Research","HCoVs|HCoV|HCoV-OC43|Renilla|Rluc|rOC43-ns2DelRluc|C57BL/6|BALB/c|HCoV|BALB/|Rluc|BALB/c|CNS|Rluc|HCoV|HCoV|CNS|HCoVs","els-covid","","","31705922","WORK_OF_ART|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|GPE|PERSON|ORG|GPE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|NORP","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104646","custom_license"

Mounting evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed prototypic mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a neglected human pathogen of clinical significance. There are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed vaccines and current anti-mammarenavirus therapy is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective and can cause significant side effects. Therefore, there is an unmet need for novel antiviral drugs to combat LASV. This task would be facilitated by the implementation of high throughput screens (HTS) to identify inhibitors of the activity of the virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) responsible for directing virus RNA genome replication and gene transcription. The use of live LASV for this purpose is jeopardized by the requirement of biosafety level 4 (BSL4) containment. We have developed a virus-free cell platform, where expression levels of reporter genes serve as accurate surrogates of vRNP activity, to develop cell-based assays compatible with HTS to identify inhibitors of LASV and LCMV mammarenavirus vRNP activities.","84e52da5894b060f5642f40b6eac9d6df16a56c6","True","Antiviral Research","Lassa|LASV|West Africa|several hundred thousand|annually|Lassa|LF|Food and Drug Administration|FDA|LASV|HTS|RNA|LASV|4|LASV","els-covid","","","31786250","ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|LAW|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104667","custom_license"

To find small molecules with anti-feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) properties, we utilized a virtual screening technique to identify the active site on the viral protease for the binding of the available natural compounds. The protease 3CL (3CLpro) plays an important role in the replication cycle of FIPV and other viruses within the family Coronaviridae. The 15 best-ranked candidate consensus compounds, based on three docking tools, were evaluated for further assays. The protease inhibitor assay on recombinant FIPV 3CLpro was performed to screen the inhibitory effect of the candidate compounds with IC50 ranging from 6.36 ± 2.15 to 78.40 ± 2.60 μM. As determined by the cell-based assay, the compounds NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256 showed better EC50 values than the broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir, under all the test conditions including pre-viral entry, post-viral entry, and prophylactic activity. The NSC87511 particularly yielded the best selective index (>4; range of SI = 13.80–22.90).

A case-control study was carried out in the 2016 spring calving season. A total of 194 bobby calves, comprising 38 cases (calves that died or were condemned for health or welfare reasons before the point of slaughter) and 156 controls (calves deemed acceptable and presented for slaughter) were included in the study. Case and control calves were selected by veterinarians located at 29 processing premises across New Zealand. Information regarding management of selected calves on-farm, during transport and at the processor was obtained retrospectively via questionnaires administered to supplying farmers, transport operators and processing premises personnel. Associations between management variables and calf mortality (death or condemnation) were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Factors associated with an increased risk of calf mortality included time in the farm of origin’s calving season, duration of travel from farm to the processor and processing slaughter schedule (same day or next day). Every additional week into the farm’s calving season increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.2 (95%CI 1.06, 1.35). Similarly, each additional hour of travel time increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.45 (95% CI 1.18, 1.76). Risk of mortality was significantly greater for calves processed at premises with a next day slaughter schedule than those processed at premises with a same day slaughter schedule (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.51, 9.67). However, when the data set was limited to those cases that died or were condemned in the yards (i.e. excluding calves that were dead or condemned on arrival) the effect of same day slaughter was not significant. In order to reduce bobby calf mortality and morbidity, transport duration should be kept as short as possible and a same day slaughter schedule applied. While these factors can be regulated, New Zealand’s pastoral dairy system means that calves will inevitably be transported for slaughter across several months each spring. Although farm management factors did not apparently influence the risk of mortality in this study, the effect of time in farm’s calving season suggests there may be farm-management related factors that change over the season. This requires further investigation.","d7ff69edc7eb8d1fc0e31314b8a4434a50a31134","True","Preventive Veterinary Medicine","New Zealand|2016|194|38|156|29|premises|New Zealand|same day|next day|Every additional week|1.2|95%CI 1.06|1.35|each additional hour|1.45|95%|1.18|1.76|next day|95%|CI 1.51|9.67|New Zealand’s|several months each spring|the season","els-covid","","","31765960","GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|LOC|GPE|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|TIME|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.104836","custom_license"

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the level of anti-C. parvum IgG antibodies transferred through colostrum from dams to newborn calves impacts the susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis. A number of 50 dams and their healthy newborns were included in the study. Colostrum samples were collected within 12 h after birth and anti-C. parvum IgG antibody levels were determined by single radial immunodiffusion. The health condition of the newborns was daily monitored, and fecal samples were collected at first diarrheic episode of a calf.

This study aimed to examine climatic, socioeconomic and geographic risk factors for CPV infection and CPV-associated euthanasia in Australia. Australian veterinary hospital responses (534; 23.5 %) to a national veterinary survey of CPV case occurrences and euthanasias in 2016 were used. Severe caseloads (>40 cases per annum) were reported by 26 (11 %) hospitals (median 60 cases; IQR 50–110). Case reporting, case numbers, and without-treatment euthanasia were significantly associated with disadvantage across all Socio-Economic Index for Areas quintiles (p < 0.0001) – the greater the disadvantage, the more reports. Strong negative correlations were found between case numbers and the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (rSP = –0.3357, p < 0.0001) and also between euthanasia and the Index of Education and Occupation (rSP = –0.3762, p < 0.0001). Hospitals in more remote areas were also more likely to report cases and to euthanize without treatment (p < 0.0001). Of the climate variables, temperature of the hottest month was most strongly positively correlated with case numbers (rSP = 0.421, p < 0.0001), and lower annual rainfall was associated with more case-reporting hospitals (p < 0.0001). These results confirm that socioeconomic disadvantage is a significant risk-factor for CPV infection and outcome, and high temperature may also contribute to risk.","611b8f1600ce3f96cc9d68c1235fc634ab17d47e","True","Preventive Veterinary Medicine","CPV|CPV-|Australia|Australian|534|23.5 %|CPV|2016|40|26|11 %|60|50–110|0.0001|the Index of Relative|Socioeconomic Disadvantage|0.0001|Occupation|–0.3762|0.0001|0.0001|0.421|0.0001|annual|0.0001|CPV","els-covid","","","31739219","ORG|ORG|GPE|NORP|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|MONEY|EVENT|GPE|PERSON|MONEY|MONEY|ORDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|FAC","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.104816","custom_license"

However, to date, no commercial vaccine is available. In this study, structural proteins of MERS-CoV were expressed in silkworm larvae and Bm5 cells for the development of vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV and diagnostic methods. The spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV lacking its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (SΔTM) was secreted into the hemolymph of silkworm larvae using a bombyxin signal peptide and purified using affinity chromatography. The purified SΔTM forms small nanoparticles as well as the full-length S protein and has the ability to bind human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which is a receptor of MERS-CoV. These results indicate that bioactive SΔTM was expressed in silkworm larvae. To produce MERS-CoV-like particles (MERS-CoV-LPs), the coexpression of spike proteins was performed in Bm5 cells and envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins secreted E and M proteins extracellularly, suggesting that MERS-CoV-LPs may be formed. However, this S protein was not displayed on virus-like particles (VLPs) even though E and M proteins were secreted into the culture supernatant. By surfactant treatment and mechanical extrusion using S protein- or three structural protein-expressing Bm5 cells, S protein-displaying nanovesicles with diameters of approximately 100-200 nm were prepared and confirmed by immuno-TEM. The mechanical extrusion method is favorable for obtaining uniform recombinant protein-displaying nanovesicles from cultured cells. The purified SΔTM from silkworm larvae and S protein-displaying nanovesicles from Bm5 cells may lead to the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines against MERS-CoV and the diagnostic detection of MERS-CoV.","5557f847ae1466924fdbb0c9c0adaa0d416680da","True","Journal of Biotechnology","Middle East|first|2012|over 2000|800|27|SΔTM|SΔTM|4|MERS-CoV.|SΔTM|CoV|CoV|CoV|S|three|approximately 100-200|TEM|SΔTM|CoV","els-covid","","","31614169","LOC|ORDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON","Elsevier","2019-12-20","","10.1016/j.jbiotec.2019.10.007","custom_license"

Crucial to halting PDCoV transmission and infection is the development of effective therapies and vaccines. The spike (S) protein of coronavirus is the major target of host neutralizing antibodies, however the immunodominant neutralizing region in the S protein of PDCoV has not been defined. Here, three truncations of the PDCoV S protein were generated, the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (NTD, amino acids (aa) 50–286), the C-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (CTD, aa 278–616), and S2 subunit (aa 601–1087). The proteins were expressed using an E. coli expression system. Polyclonal antisera against the three recombinant proteins were produced in rabbits and mice. All three antisera were able to inhibit PDCoV infection in vitro, as determined by virus neutralization assay, fluorescent focus neutralization assay, and plaque-reduction neutralization. The CTD-specific antisera had the most potent PDCoV-neutralizing effect, indicating that the CTD region may contain the major neutralizing epitope(s) in the PDCoV S protein. Based on these findings, CTD may be a promising target for development of an effective vaccine against PDCoV infection in pigs.","dfe7efa99b2805f018714d78ba28d80afbac589b","True","Virus Research","PDCoV|PDCoV|three|the PDCoV S|S1|NTD|50–286|S1|CTD|601–1087)|three|three|CTD|CTD|PDCoV S|CTD","els-covid","","","31816342","GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-15","","10.1016/j.virusres.2019.197834","custom_license"

Very recently, a new group of insect-specific viruses, the Mesoniviridae family, was discovered in Africa, Asia, North America and Australia. Here we report the first detection and isolation of a new virus belonging to Mesonivirus genus in Senegal, West Africa. The so-called Dianke virus was detected in 21 species of arthropods trapped in the eastern part of the country. Male individuals were also infected, supporting vertical transmission assertion of insect specific viruses. As described for other mesoniviruses, no viral replication was observed after inoculation of mammalian cells. Viral replication in mosquito cells was blocked at a temperature of 37 °C, highlighting the importance of thermal conditions in Mesonivirus host restriction. Similar to our study, where a diverse range of arthropod vectors were found infected by the new virus, several studies have detected mesonivirus infection in mosquitoes with concerns for human health. It has been shown that dual infections in mosquito can alter viral infectivity. Due to their extensive geographic distribution and host range, as well as their use as potential disease control agents in vector populations, more studies should be done for a better knowledge of arthropod-restricted viruses prevalence and diversity.","79f8b8851944209659f612965e7f373a941a9a0c","True","Virus Research","Mesoniviridae|Africa|Asia|North America|Australia|first|Mesonivirus|Senegal|West Africa|Dianke|21|37|Mesonivirus","els-covid","","","31697989","PERSON|LOC|LOC|LOC|GPE|ORDINAL|PERSON|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PRODUCT","Elsevier","2020-01-02","","10.1016/j.virusres.2019.197802","custom_license"

In this study, 5 monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against the PEDV N-protein were prepared and identified. Three new epitopes, 56QIRWRMRRGERI67, 318GYAQIASLAPNVAALLFGGNVA VRE342 and 398HEEAIYDDV406, were firstly identified in the viral N-protein, by using McAbs 3F10, 6A11, and 1C9. The epitope 398HEEAIYDDV406 was deleted in SH strain (isolated by our lab) and different between CV777 and YZ strain (isolated by our lab). To study the characters of this epitope, four peptides were synthesized according to the sequence of SH and CV777 and used in the study. The result showed that the 398th amino acid maybe an important amino acid of the epitope. Biological information analysis showed that the three B cell linear epitopes are highly conserved among different PEDV isolates. In addition, McAb 1C9, which attached to the epitope 398HEEAIYDDV406, showed variant reactivity with PEDV CV777, SH, YZ and MS strains. McAb 1C9 reacted with PEDV strains CV777 and YZ, but not with SH which had a deletion from 399 to 410 amino acids in N-protein (No. MK841494). Among the three McAbs, 6A11, 3F10 and 1C9, only 6A11 reacted with porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in immunofluorescence assay, therefore the other two could be used to distinguish TGEV and PEDV. These mAbs and their defined epitopes may provide useful tool for the study of the PEDV N-protein structure and function, and facilitate the development of diagnostic methods for PEDV.","ad43c769683f0fa927070574e82e790e95bfff3a","True","Virus Research","5|McAbs|Three|56QIRWRMRRGERI67|318GYAQIASLAPNVAALLFGGNVA|VRE342|398HEEAIYDDV406|McAbs 3F10|6A11|1C9|398HEEAIYDDV406|SH|CV777|YZ|four|SH|CV777|398th|three|1C9|398HEEAIYDDV406|SH|YZ|1C9|CV777|YZ|SH|399|410|MK841494|three|McAbs|6A11|3F10|1C9|6A11|TGEV|two|TGEV|mAbs","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|FAC|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-05-31","","10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197912","custom_license"

We then inhibited SGLT1 expression by lentiviral interference and drug inhibition, respectively. Inhibition studies showed that the level of phosphorylation of the downstream key proteins, MAPKAPK-2 and EZRIN, in the SGLT1-mediated p38MAPK/AKt2 signaling pathway was significantly increased. The surface NHE3 expression was also significantly increased, and NHE3 activity was also significantly enhanced.

Recently, depletion of macrophages in vivo after vaccination has shown to drastically diminish the protection against FMDV challenge in mouse model. Even the ability of macrophages to reduce or resist FMDV infection is not known hitherto. Therefore, we examined the replication ability of FMDV in mice peritoneal macrophages and the responsiveness in terms of macrophage polarization and cytokine production. Negative strand specific RT-PCR indicated replication of FMDV RNA in macrophages. Absolute quantitation of FMDV transcripts, immunofluorescence studies and titre of the infectious progeny virus revealed that replication peaked at 12 hpi and significantly declined by 18 hpi indicating non-progressive replication in the infected macrophages. Further, significant up regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase by 8 –12 hpi and increase of M1 specific CD11c + cells by 42.6 % after infection showed that FMDV induce M1 polarization. A significant up regulation of TNFα and IL12 transcripts at 8 hpi supported that M1 macrophages were functional. Further, we studied the expression of Type I to III interferons (IFN) and other antiviral molecules. The results indicate a marked up regulation of Type I IFNα and β by 9.2 and 11.2 fold, respectively at 8 hpi. Of the four IFN stimulated genes (ISG), viperin showed a significant up regulation by 286-fold at 12 hpi in the mice macrophages. In conclusion, the results suggest that replication of FMDV in mice peritoneal macrophages is non-progressive with up regulation of Type I IFN and ISGs. Further, FMDV induces M1 polarization in murine peritoneal macrophages.","80dc09241dcd1a352c550ef3d8635c87c5399d22","True","Virus Research","RT-PCR|FMDV RNA|12|18|8|M1|42.6 %|M1|IL12|8|M1|9.2|11.2|8|four|IFN|ISG|286-fold|12|M1","els-covid","","","32109526","ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|PERCENT|PRODUCT|LOC|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|PRODUCT","Elsevier","2020-05-31","","10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197906","custom_license"
"Spencer, James H.; Finucane, Melissa L.; Fox, Jefferson M.; Saksena, Sumeet; Sultana, Nargis","Emerging infectious disease, the household built environment characteristics, and urban planning: Evidence on avian influenza in Vietnam","Abstract Recent concerns with pandemic outbreaks of human disease and their origins in animal populations have ignited concerns regarding connections between Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) and development. As disasters, health, and infectious disease become part of planning concern (Matthew & McDonald, 2007), greater focus on household infrastructure and EID disease outbreaks among poultry is warranted. Following Spencer (2013), this study examines the relationship between the mix of household-scale water supplies, sanitation systems, and construction materials, and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) among poultry in a developing country: Vietnam. Findings of our multivariate logistic regressions suggest that a non-linear, Kuznets-shaped urban transition (Spencer, 2013) has an independent effect on the outbreak of HPAI, especially as it relates to household-level sanitation infrastructure. We conclude that the Kuznets-shape development of household infrastructure characteristics in Vietnam play a significant role in explaining where poultry outbreaks occur. Using secondary data from the Census of Population and Housing, and the Agricultural Census at the District and Commune levels for the country of Vietnam, we performed logistic regression to test the relationship between outbreaks of HPAI in poultry and newly-developed “coherence indices” (Spencer, 2013) of household water supply, sanitation, and construction materials that measure nonlinear, transitional development. Results show that district-scale coherence indices are negatively and independently correlated with HPAI outbreaks, especially for sanitation. Findings also suggest that community-scale coherence of urban infrastructures is a powerful tool for predicting where HPAI poultry outbreaks are likely to occur, thereby providing health planners new tools for efficient surveillance.","ac483ee226f5b5125ca1efe06aa2e0c7f16cff94","True","Landscape and Urban Planning","Emerging Infectious Diseases|EID|Matthew & McDonald|2007|EID|Spencer|2013|Pathogenic Avian|Influenza|HPAI|Vietnam|Spencer|2013|HPAI|Kuznets|Vietnam|the Census of Population and Housing|the Agricultural Census|Commune|Vietnam|HPAI|Spencer|2013|HPAI|HPAI","els-covid","","","","PERSON|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|PERSON|DATE|PERSON|NORP|ORG|GPE|PERSON|DATE|ORG|FAC|GPE|ORG|ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|DATE|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103681","custom_license"

These activities may place the family member at risk from a health care–associated infection. This study aimed to examine whether the role of patients’ families has been accounted for in the infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines and policy, using examples from Bangladesh (low-income country), Indonesia (middle-income country), and South Korea (high-income country). Methods The World Health Organization website and Institutional Repository for Information Sharing, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, Australian Government Web Archive, Open Grey, Grey Matters, World Bank, and advanced Google search, as well as the Health Department/Ministry of Health websites for each target country and 4 western countries (Australia, Canada, England, and the United States) were searched. Other databases, such as Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Global Health, ProQuest databases, Google scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus were also searched. This was to review the reflection of the cultural influence in IPC policies/guidelines by reviewing those from the global organizations, which are often used as a blueprint for policy development, as well as those from western countries, which hold different cultures in care arrangement. Search was conducted with attention to the key areas: definition and role of carer in the acute health care facility, involvement of patients/family members in IPC activities, patient and family member hand hygiene, and IPC education. Results Ninety-two articles were identified based on the criteria for the study. Only 6 acknowledged that care is provided to hospitalized patients by their family members, and only 1 recommended that family members receive the same level of training as health care workers on IPC precautions. Other guides recommended the provision of information on IPC measures as means of patient involvement in the IPC program. Recognition of family caregivers or inclusion of them in the IPC strategies was not included in the target countries’ guidelines. Conclusions Although health care workers are the primary actors when it comes to providing care in acute health care settings, it is important to expand the IPC guides by considering the role of other caregivers. Policies and guidelines should reflect the cultural influence over healthcare. This is especially true when cultural values strongly influence over healthcare arrangements and the healthcare accommodates these cultural influences in the practice. Further work needs to be undertaken on the level of training/education provided to family members in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and South Korea.","18d974723052f0e2a2252691db19ae332463fe7c","True","American Journal of Infection Control","Asian|Bangladesh|Indonesia|South Korea|Methods The World Health Organization|Institutional Repository for Information Sharing|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Australian|Archive|Open Grey|Grey Matters|World Bank|Google|the Health Department/Ministry of Health|4|Australia|Canada|England|the United States|Embase|Medline|CINAHL|Global Health|ProQuest|Google|Web of Science|Scopus|IPC|Search|IPC|IPC|Ninety-two|Only 6|only 1|IPC|IPC|IPC|IPC|IPC|Bangladesh|Indonesia|South Korea","els-covid","","","","NORP|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|NORP|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE","Elsevier","2020-01-07","","10.1016/j.ajic.2019.10.001","custom_license"

Foreign nationality, non-Chinese ethnicity, and age above 40 years were independently associated with baseline LTBI, whereas having >2 TB exposure episodes and working in internal medicine, medical subspecialties, and psychiatry wards were associated with QFT-GIT conversion. Discussion The QFT-GIT conversion rate among screened HCWs is low. Foreign HCWs with LTBI likely came from countries with higher TB transmission. Targeted prevention of repeated TB exposures can reduce QFT-GIT conversion. Conclusions The study results will guide TB contact tracing protocols in health care institutions.","db1f2e3f0b16df42a30f5bbb6b7508127a05de1f","True","American Journal of Infection Control","August 2016 to January 2018|tertiary|Singapore|Demographic|HCW|Poisson|32|881|1,536|QuantiFERON-TB Gold|QFT|8 weeks|129|14.6%|QFT-TB|22|2.5%|QFT|1.14|100|Chinese|40 years|2|QFT|Targeted|QFT","els-covid","","","31806237","DATE|ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-02","","10.1016/j.ajic.2019.10.014","custom_license"
"Nguyen, Le Khanh Ngan; Megiddo, Itamar; Howick, Susan","Simulation models for transmission of health care–associated infection: A systematic review","Background Health care–associated infections (HAIs) are a global health burden because of their significant impact on patient health and health care systems. Mechanistic simulation modeling that captures the dynamics between patients, pathogens, and the environment is increasingly being used to improve understanding of epidemiological patterns of HAIs and to facilitate decisions on infection prevention and control (IPC). The purpose of this review is to present a systematic review to establish (1) how simulation models have been used to investigate HAIs and their mitigation and (2) how these models have evolved over time, as well as identify (3) gaps in their adoption and (4) useful directions for their future development. Methods The review involved a systematic search and identification of studies using system dynamics, discrete event simulation, and agent-based model to study HAIs. Results The complexity of simulation models developed for HAIs significantly increased but heavily concentrated on transmission dynamics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the hospitals of high-income countries. Neither HAIs in other health care settings, the influence of contact networks within a health care facility, nor patient sharing and referring networks across health care settings were sufficiently understood. Conclusions This systematic review provides a broader overview of existing simulation models in HAIs to identify the gaps and to direct and facilitate further development of appropriate models in this emerging field.","aa8a78f830731f32a7c18fb9f32efd050b8dc7c0","True","American Journal of Infection Control","IPC|3|4|Staphylococcus","els-covid","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-18","","10.1016/j.ajic.2019.11.005","custom_license"

It remains unclear as to why proper hand hygiene practices cannot be sustained and what role health literacy plays in older adults fight against infectious diseases. Methods A convenience sample of 433 old adults aged 65 and above was recruited. Their hygiene practices and health literacy were evaluated using a structured questionnaire adopted from the Centre for Health Protection and the Chinese version of the HLS-Asia-Q questionnaire. Results The percentage distribution of the hand hygiene performance, from always to never, was 18%-10%. A majority 63.28% (274) of them were classified as having inadequate health literacy (0-25), while a meager 1.62% (7) of them as having excellent health literacy (42.01-50). The Spearman correlation showed a significant positive relationship (P < 0.05) between the participants’ health literacy and their hand hygiene practices. Conclusions Health literacy and hand hygiene are positively related in helping the older adults fight against infectious diseases. To sustain proper hand hygiene practices is to provide frequent hand hygiene training to the older adults.","1574c96f416c694cd48e86e3173fcf8d92eaa052","True","American Journal of Infection Control","433|65|the Centre for Health Protection|Chinese|HLS|18%-10%|63.28%|274|0-25|1.62%|42.01-50|Spearman|0.05|participants’","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|NORP|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE","Elsevier","2020-02-07","","10.1016/j.ajic.2019.12.021","custom_license"

Methods A total of 10,429 specimens were analyzed, and IgM antibodies against 9 respiratory pathogens including MP were detected using indirect immunofluorescence assay from serum. Results It showed that 59.3% of the enrolled children were positive for at least 1 pathogen; highest detection rates included those between 3 and <6 years of age (70.4%), female (63.2%), and who were hospitalized in 2014 (80.9%). The most predominant pathogen was MP (45.6%), followed by Parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) (22.6%) and influenza B viruses (IFVB) (14.7%). Coinfection was observed in 2,907 specimens (27.9%); the coinfection combination containing MP and PIVs had the highest detection rate of 15%, followed by MP and IFVB as well as IFVB and PIVs. Conclusions MP was the most commonly detected bacteria among hospitalized children, which should be included in the differential diagnosis for hospitalized children with RTI.

Although the emergence of infectious diseases and their subsequent spread have a significant impact on global health and economics, a comprehensive literature evaluation of this topic has yet to be carried out. Thus, the current study encompasses the first systematic, identifiable and comprehensive academic literature evaluation and classification of the fuzzy logic methods in infectious diseases. 40 papers on this topic, which have been published from 2005 to 2019 and related to the human infectious diseases were evaluated and analyzed. The findings of this evaluation clearly show that the fuzzy logic methods are vastly used for diagnosis of diseases such as dengue fever, hepatitis and tuberculosis. The key fuzzy logic methods used for the infectious disease are the fuzzy inference system; the rule-based fuzzy logic, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and fuzzy cognitive map. Furthermore, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve were universally applied for a performance evaluation of the fuzzy logic techniques. This thesis will also address the various needs between the different industries, practitioners and researchers to encourage more research regarding the more overlooked areas, and it will conclude with several suggestions for the future infectious disease researches.","f2dfd35b3a2271ca50721029d2c75fce4139d7b9","True","Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering","first|40|2005|2019|Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System|ANFIS|the Receiver Operating Characteristic|ROC","els-covid","","","","ORDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.bbe.2019.09.004","custom_license"

Abstract Introduction Experimental animal models constitute a useful tool to deepen our knowledge of central nervous system disorders. In the case of multiple sclerosis, however, there is no such specific model able to provide an overview of the disease; multiple models covering the different pathophysiological features of the disease are therefore necessary. Development We reviewed the different in vitro and in vivo experimental models used in multiple sclerosis research. Concerning in vitro models, we analysed cell cultures and slice models. As for in vivo models, we examined such models of autoimmunity and inflammation as experimental allergic encephalitis in different animals and virus-induced demyelinating diseases. Furthermore, we analysed models of demyelination and remyelination, including chemical lesions caused by cuprizone, lysolecithin, and ethidium bromide; zebrafish; and transgenic models. Conclusions Experimental models provide a deeper understanding of the different pathogenic mechanisms involved in multiple sclerosis. Choosing one model or another depends on the specific aims of the study.","232f839bc7dbda4ef8ae03a75fd5beb2cdb38ca9","True","Neurología","de la|de|Se|Conclusiones Los|al conocimiento de|La|Conclusions Experimental","els-covid","","","","PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|GPE|PERSON|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.nrl.2017.07.002","custom_license"

Conformationally unrestricted spacer between the lactone and 1,2,3-triazole units in 8a−8u series had a profound effect on antitumor activity. Besides, the introduction of a long side chain at C-4 of 1,2,3-triazole that led to the synthesis of decyl-substituted 2,3-dibenzyl-l-ascorbic acid 8m accounted for a selective and potent antiproliferative activity on breast cancer MCF-7 cells cells in the nM range. Further analysis showed that compound 8m strongly enhanced expression of hypoxia inducible transcription factor 1 α (HIF-1α) and to some extent decreased expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) suggesting its role in regulating HIF-1α signalling pathway. The p-methoxyphenyl-substituted derivative 10g displayed specific anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) potential, whereas aliphatic-substituted derivatives 8l and 8m had the most potent, yet relatively non-specific, anti-varicella-zoster (VZV) activity.","23288b8c9fa1e91b2617ec589fdaf1902463ff3e","True","European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","Two|6-(1,2,3-triazolyl)-2,3-dibenzyl-l|8a−8u|seven|1,2,3-triazole|8a−8u|1,2,3-triazole|2,3-dibenzyl|8m|8m|1|HIF-1α|2|NOS2|HIF-1α|10|CMV|8l|8m|VZV","els-covid","","","31586832","CARDINAL|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-15","","10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.111739","custom_license"

Consequently, this has created an exigency in the search for new drugs with improved clinical utility or means of potentiating available ones. To this end, accumulating empirical evidence supports molecular target therapy as a plausible egress and, β-glucuronidase (βGLU) – a lysosomal acid hydrolase responsible for the catalytic deconjugation of β-d-glucuronides has emerged as a viable molecular target for several therapeutic applications. The enzyme’s activity level in body fluids is also deemed a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of some pathological conditions. Moreover, due to its role in colon carcinogenesis and certain drug-induced dose-limiting toxicities, the development of potent inhibitors of βGLU in human intestinal microbiota has aroused increased attention over the years. Nevertheless, although our literature survey revealed both natural products and synthetic scaffolds as potential inhibitors of the enzyme, only few of these have found clinical utility, albeit with moderate to poor pharmacokinetic profile. Hence, in this review we present a compendium of exploits in the present millennium directed towards the inhibition of βGLU. The aim is to proffer a platform on which new scaffolds can be modelled for improved βGLU inhibitory potency and the development of new therapeutic agents in consequential.","185380f4c8c1fd97f5f526739ca63c0942f77668","True","European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","enzyme|the years|the present millennium","els-covid","","","31835168","DATE|DATE|DATE","Elsevier","2020-02-01","","10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.111921","custom_license"

However, these exhibit substantial cytotoxicity. As this cytotoxicity may be attributed to 5′-phosphorylation, we designed and synthesized one-carbon homologated 6′-fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues. This modification prevents 5′-phosphorlyation by cellular kinases, whereas the inhibitory activity towards S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase will be retained. The enantiomerically pure 6′-fluorinated-5′-homoaristeromycin analogues 3a-e were synthesized via the electrophilic fluorination of the silyl enol ether with Selectfluor, using a base-build up approach as the key steps. All synthesized compounds exhibited potent inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase, among which 6′-β-fluoroadenosine analogue 3a was the most potent (IC50 = 0.36 μM). Among the compounds tested, 6′-β-fluoro-homoaristeromycin 3a showed potent antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.12 μM) against the CHIKV, without noticeable cytotoxicity up to 250 μM. Only 3a displayed anti-CHIKV activity, whereas both3a and 3b inhibited SAH hydrolase with similar IC50 values (0.36 and 0.37 μM, respectively), which suggested that 3a’s antiviral activity did not merely depend on the inhibition of SAH hydrolase. This is further supported by the fact that the antiviral effect was specific for CHIKV and some other alphaviruses and none of the homologated analogues inhibited other RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and ZIKV. The potent inhibition and high selectivity index make 6′-β-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (3a) a promising new template for the development of antivirals against CHIKV, a serious re-emerging pathogen that has infected millions of people over the past 15 years.","57104097c3644dae34bb5a10720fcfe662f753ea","True","European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","1|6′-fluorinated|2|RNA|Middle East|Zika|ZIKV|Chikungunya|CHIKV|5′-phosphorylation|one|6′-fluorinated|5′-phosphorlyation|SAH|6′-fluorinated-5′-homoaristeromycin|3a|Selectfluor|SAH|6′-β-fluoroadenosine|6′-β-fluoro-homoaristeromycin|3a|0.12|μM|CHIKV|up to 250|μM.|3a|CHIKV|3b|SAH|IC50|0.36|0.37|3a|SAH|CHIKV|RNA|CoV|CoV|ZIKV|6′-β-fluoro-homoaristeromycin|3a|CHIKV|millions|the past 15 years","els-covid","","","31841728","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|LOC|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|TIME|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|TIME|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|DATE|LAW|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE","Elsevier","2020-02-01","","10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.111956","custom_license"

A simulation for 2018–2021 demonstrates the sustained impact of this policy. The results show that the number of tourists to Taiwan from China reached its peak in 2015 at 41% and will decrease to 9% by 2021.

The feasibility study investigates the reliability of the state of the art heart rate measuring methods in realistic situations. Therefore, an experiment was designed and carried out on 45 subjects to investigate the effects caused by illumination, motion, skin tone, and distance variance. The experiment was conducted for two main scenarios; human-computer interaction scenario and health monitoring scenario. The human-computer scenario investigated the effects caused by illumination variance, motion variance, and skin tone variance. The health monitoring scenario investigates the feasibility of health monitoring at public spaces (i.e. airports, subways, malls). Five state of the art heart rate measuring methods were re-implemented and tested with the feasibility study database. The results were compared with ground truth to estimate the heart rate measurement error. The heart rate measurement error was analyzed using mean error, standard deviation; root means square error and Pearson correlation coefficient. The findings of this experiment inferred promising results for health monitoring of subjects standing at a distance of 500 cm.","85a16ac544ae407ea26920d469f00ec846f37c34","True","Measurement","two|Five|Pearson|500 cm","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|QUANTITY","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.measurement.2019.07.032","custom_license"

In the first experiment, chicks were divided into four groups; one unvaccinated and three groups vaccinated with live NDV VG/GA-Avinew, live H120 + CR88, or VG/GA-Avinew + H120 + CR88. In the second experiment, live aMPV subtype B vaccine was used in place of NDV. Clinical signs were monitored daily and oropharyngeal swabs were taken at regular intervals for vaccine virus detection. Blood was collected at 21 dpv for serology. 10 chicks from each group were challenged with virulent strains of M41 or QX or aMPV subtype B. For IBV, after 5 days post challenge (dpc), tracheal ciliary protection was assessed. For aMPV, clinical scores were recorded up to 10 dpc. For NDV, haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres were assayed as an indicator of protective immunity. In both experiments, ciliary protection for IBV vaccinated groups was maintained above 90%. The protection against virulent aMPV challenge was not compromised when aMPV, H120 and CR88 were co-administered. NDV HI mean titres in single and combined NDV-vaccinated groups remained above the protective titre (>3 log2). Both experiments demonstrated that simultaneous administration of live NDV VG/GA-Avinew or aMPV subtype B alongside H120 and CR88 vaccines does not interfere with protection conferred against NDV, IBV or aMPV.","03fea4a49ce80db75ae5c76eeaa176a87ce668a6","True","Vaccine","NDV|two|IBV (Massachusetts|day-old|first|four|one|three|NDV|GA-Avinew|CR88|VG/GA-Avinew|CR88|second|NDV|daily|21|10|M41|QX|B.

"Wolff, Greg G.","Influenza vaccination and respiratory virus interference among Department of Defense personnel during the 2017–2018 influenza season","Abstract Purpose Receiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as virus interference. Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness. The virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness, thus potentially biasing vaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction. This study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among Department of Defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status. Furthermore, individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined. Results We compared vaccination status of 2880 people with non-influenza respiratory viruses to 3240 people with pan-negative results. Comparing vaccinated to non-vaccinated patients, the adjusted odds ratio for non-flu viruses was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 1.09; p = 0.60). Additionally, the vaccination status of 3349 cases of influenza were compared to three different control groups: all controls (N = 6120), non-influenza positive controls (N = 2880), and pan-negative controls (N = 3240). The adjusted ORs for the comparisons among the three control groups did not vary much (range: 0.46–0.51). Conclusions Receipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with virus interference among our population. Examining virus interference by specific respiratory viruses showed mixed results. Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus; however, significant protection with vaccination was associated not only with most influenza viruses, but also parainfluenza, RSV, and non-influenza virus coinfections.","d03cf2f21e08b7e0df78531221da6c06915e1b50","True","Vaccine","Department of Defense|2880|3240|0.97|95%|CI|0.86|1.09|0.60|3349|three|6120|2880|3240|three|0.46–0.51|RSV","els-covid","","","31607599","ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-10","","10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.10.005","custom_license"

Currently, one of the most relevant genotypes circulating worldwide is IBV-QX (GI-19), for which vaccines have been developed by passaging virulent QX strains in embryonated chicken eggs. Here we explored the attenuated phenotype of a commercially available QX live vaccine, IB Primo QX, in specific pathogens free broilers. At hatch, birds were inoculated with QX vaccine or its virulent progenitor IBV-D388, and postmortem swabs and tissues were collected each day up to eight days post infection to assess viral replication and morphological changes. In the trachea, viral RNA replication and protein expression were comparable in both groups. Both viruses induced morphologically comparable lesions in the trachea, albeit with a short delay in the vaccinated birds. In contrast, in the kidney, QX vaccine viral RNA was nearly absent, which coincided with the lack of any morphological changes in this organ. This was in contrast to high viral RNA titers and abundant lesions in the kidney after IBV D388 infection. Furthermore, QX vaccine showed reduced ability to reach and replicate in conjunctivae and intestines including cloaca, resulting in significantly lower titers and delayed protein expression, respectively. Nephropathogenic IBVs might reach the kidney also via an ascending route from the cloaca, based on our observation that viral RNA was detected in the cloaca one day before detection in the kidney. In the kidney distal tubular segments, collecting ducts and ureter were positive for viral antigen. Taken together, the attenuated phenotype of QX vaccine seems to rely on slower dissemination and lower replication in target tissues other than the site of inoculation.","494c12e69a184761d961154377519151c9fd10c8","True","Vaccine","IB|IBV|one|IBV-QX|QX|IB Primo QX|QX|IBV-D388|each day up to eight days|RNA|QX|RNA|RNA|IBV D388|QX|Nephropathogenic IBVs|RNA|one day|QX","els-covid","","","31822427","GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-05","","10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.11.064","custom_license"

A reverse genetic vaccine is a safe, rapid, and effective method of achieving IB prevention and control. In this study, we constructed the recombinant strain, rH120-S1/YZ, using a reverse genetic system, based on the backbone of the H120 vaccine strain, with the S1 gene replaced with that of the QX-like nephropathogenic strain, ck/CH/IBYZ/2011, isolated in China. The results of dwarf chicken embryos, growth kinetics, and viral titration in the embryos demonstrated that the biological characteristics of the recombinant virus remained unchanged. Like the rH120-infected group and in contrast to the rIBYZ-infected group, no mortality, clinical signs, or lesions were observed in the lungs or kidneys of young chickens inoculated with rH120-S1/YZ. The viral loads in various tissues, cloacal, and oral swabs was lower in most types of samples, indicating that the rH120-S1/YZ strain was highly safe in chicks. Compared to rH120 vaccination group, when the efficacy of this strain was evaluated against the QX-like IBV strain, better protection, with 100% survival rate and no disease symptom or gross lesion was observed in the chickens vaccinated with rH120-S1/YZ. Increased levels of IBV-specific antibodies were detected in the serum of the rH120-S1/YZ-vaccinated animals 14 days post-vaccination. Collectively, our results suggest that the recombinant strain, rH120-S1/YZ, may represent a promising vaccine candidate against QX-like IBVs.","59f95cafe30a91dc89dac31635354bb839443123","True","Vaccine","IB|IB|S1|QX|China|rH120-infected|rIBYZ|rH120|QX|IBV|100%|IBV|14 days|QX","els-covid","","","","GPE|ORG|NORP|ORG|GPE|ORG|NORP|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-30","","10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.001","custom_license"

Zika envelope domain III (ZE3) has been identified as a safe and effective vaccine candidate, however it is poorly immunogenic. We previously showed that plant-made recombinant immune complex (RIC) vaccines are a robust platform to improve the immunogenicity of weak antigens. In this study, we altered the antigen fusion site on the RIC platform to accommodate N-terminal fusion to the IgG heavy chain (N-RIC), and thus a wider range of antigens, with a resulting 40% improvement in RIC expression over the normal C-terminal fusion (C-RIC). Both types of RICs containing ZE3 were efficiently assembled in plants and purified to >95% homogeneity with a simple one-step purification. Both ZE3 RICs strongly bound complement receptor C1q and elicited strong ZE3-specific antibody titers that correlated with ZIKV neutralization. When either N-RIC or C-RIC was codelivered with plant-produced hepatitis B core (HBc) virus-like particles (VLP) displaying ZE3, the combination elicited 5-fold greater antibody titers (>1,000,000) and more strongly neutralized ZIKV than either RICs or VLPs alone, after only two doses without adjuvant. These findings demonstrate that antigens that require a free N-terminus for optimal antigen display can now be used with the RIC system, and that plant-made RICs and VLPs are highly effective vaccines targeting ZE3. Thus, the RIC platform can be more generally applied to a wider variety of antigens.","274f7dd4453774e2ff06e5fef0c0a2f694cc49b2","True","Vaccine","ZIKV|Zika|III|RIC|RIC|IgG|N-RIC|40%|RIC|C-RIC|95%|one|ZIKV|N-RIC|C-RIC|VLP|5-fold|1,000,000|ZIKV|only two|RIC|ZE3|RIC","els-covid","","","","PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|PERCENT|ORG|PRODUCT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERSON|PRODUCT|PRODUCT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-12","","10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.02.089","custom_license"

Understanding how LPs work from a structural and biophysical standpoint through investigating their interaction with cell membranes is crucial for the rational design of these biomolecules. Various analytical techniques have been developed for studying intramolecular interactions with high resolution. However, these tools have been barely exploited in lipopeptide-lipid interactions studies. These biophysical approaches would give precise insight on these interactions. Here, we reviewed these state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Knowledge at this level is indispensable for understanding LPs activity and particularly their potential specificity, which is relevant information for safe application.

We aimed to evaluate the relation between vitamin D levels, viral infections and severity of attacks in children with recurrent wheezing. Materials and methods A total of 52 patients who applied with wheezing, at the ages of 12–60 months with a history of three or more wheezing attacks in the last year and 54 healthy children were included. Sociodemographic data, risk factors for recurrent wheezing, and the severity of the wheezing attacks were recorded. 25(OH)D3, calcium, phosphor, alkaline phosphatase and parathormone levels of all children were measured. Nasopharyngeal samples of the patients for viruses were studied by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results For the patient group, being breastfed for six months or less, history of cesarean section, cigarette exposure, humid home environment, and family history of allergic disease were significantly higher compared with the control group. Serum vitamin D levels in the patient group were significantly lower compared to the control group. There was no significant relationship between vitamin D levels and hospitalization, oxygen or steroid therapy. Virus was detected in 38 patients (73%). Rhinovirus (63.2%) was the most frequently detected virus. Coinfection was found in 14 (36.8%) patients.

This technique delivers date-stamping strategies for the emergence as well as collapse of explosive bubble episodes and is best suited for practical application to time series. The results reveal that four explosive bubbles are detected over the period of 1980–2019 when copper price deviates from fundamental value. Besides, this finding is in accordance with the asset pricing model (Gürkaynak, 2008), which generally considers both fundamental and bubble components in the presence of asset prices. Based on the empirical results, the multiple emergence and collapse of multiple price bubbles are attributed to speculation, depreciation of the U.S. dollar, an imbalance between supply and demand, and financial crises. Policymakers should actively recognize bubble episodes and monitor their evolution, which could be conducive to achieving the effective stabilization of the international copper price. To reduce excess price fluctuations and explosive copper bubbles, authorities should impose restrictions on excessive speculative behaviors under extreme market conditions.","db25cdd9c15449159a9b38fe0d0c6533a5986d8c","True","Resources Policy","the Generalized Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller|GSADF|Phillips|2013|four|1980–2019|Gürkaynak|2008|U.S.","els-covid","","","","PERSON|ORG|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101587","custom_license"

Results show that MB degradation by the VUV/UV/PS process was significantly higher than that of the conventional UV/PS process, as the VUV photolysis of H2O and PS generated more reactive oxygen species (ROSs). HO• and SO4 •‒, identified as the main ROSs, were mostly consumed by dissolved organic carbon and Cl‒ in real waters, respectively. Additionally, the impacts of solution pH and the concentrations of PS, humic acid, and inorganic ions (HCO3 ‒, Cl‒, NO3 ‒, SO4 2‒, Fe(II), and Fe(III)) were systematically evaluated. The solution pH significantly affected the photon absorption distributions, as well as the contributions of photolysis and oxidation to MB degradation, resulting in different variations in the degradation rate constant and total organic carbon removal ratio with increasing solution pH. At all tested pH levels (3.0–11.0), particularly under acidic conditions, HO• and SO4 •‒ were two predominant contributors to MB degradation, while VUV and UV photolysis contributed more when the solution pH increased.

This paper analyzes interactions between three groups in time and space using a classic SIR (susceptible, infected, and recovered) epidemic model. Through social network theory and analog simulation analysis, we utilize data from China's Sina Weibo (a popular social media platform) to conduct empirical research on 101 major incidents in China that occurred between 2010 and 2017. We divide these emergencies into four types—natural disasters, accidents, public health events, and social security events—and conduct a simulation using three examples from each group. The results show that government control of public opinion is both cheaper and more effective when it occurs at the initial stages of an incident. By cooperating with the government, the media can facilitate emergency management. Finally, if netizens trust the government and the media, they are more likely to make cooperative decisions, maintain interest, and improve the management of online public sentiment.","d8d40ef3169d775e651452f6db98618a06f47d45","True","Information Processing & Management","three|SIR|China|Sina Weibo|101|China|between 2010 and 2017|four|three|netizens","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|PERSON|FAC|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102177","custom_license"
"Kennedy, James R.","Phosphatidylserine’s role in Ebola’s inflammatory cytokine storm and hemorrhagic consumptive coagulopathy and the therapeutic potential of annexin V","Abstract The phosphatidylserine (PS) molecule is present in cell membranes where it is actively kept on their inner leaflets but when cells are damaged it moves to the surface and become a signal for their removal, the platform upon which the coagulation cascade takes place and a ligand that activates a feedback cycle of inflammatory cytokine secretion and initiates the wakeup call for the innate immune response. These are physiologic responses to PS but the Ebola virus displays PS molecules on its membrane’s surface and the huge numbers of viruses cause a pathologic inflammatory cytokine storm and a hemorrhagic consumptive coagulopathy. Annexin V is an innate molecule that can cloak membrane displayed PS and prevents its Th1 cell’s inflammatory cytokine generation and cascade thrombin generation. The hypothesis presented is that its administration will cloak PS and prevent Ebola’s consumptive coagulopathy and its cytokine storm.","bbbe27910b4ebd986f966e26977833bf9d6e9787","True","Medical Hypotheses","PS|PS|PS|Annexin|PS|PS","els-covid","","","31731057","ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.mehy.2019.109462","custom_license"
"Samanta, Sudip; Tiwari, Pankaj Kumar; Alzahrani, Abdullah K.; Alshomrani, Ali Saleh","Chaos in a nonautonomous eco-epidemiological model with delay","Abstract In this paper, we propose and analyze a nonautonomous predator-prey model with disease in prey, and a discrete time delay for the incubation period in disease transmission. Employing the theory of differential inequalities, we find sufficient conditions for the permanence of the system. Further, we use Lyapunov’s functional method to obtain sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability of the system. We observe that the permanence of the system is unaffected due to presence of incubation delay. However, incubation delay affects the global stability of the positive periodic solution of the system. To reinforce the analytical results and to get more insight into the system’s behavior, we perform some numerical simulations of the autonomous and nonautonomous systems with and without time delay. We observe that for the gradual increase in the magnitude of incubation delay, the autonomous system develops limit cycle oscillation through a Hopf-bifurcation while the corresponding nonautonomous system shows chaotic dynamics through quasi-periodic oscillations. We apply basic tools of non-linear dynamics such as Poincaré section and maximum Lyapunov exponent to confirm the chaotic behavior of the system.","bd58cb5a6388e475b066a8046076596884e5fd71","True","Applied Mathematical Modelling","Lyapunov|Hopf|Poincaré|Lyapunov","els-covid","","","","PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.apm.2019.11.006","custom_license"
"Keshavarzian, Erfan; Jin, Ruizhi; Dong, Kejun; Kwok, Kenny C.S.; Zhang, Yu; Zhao, Ming","Effect of pollutant source location on air pollutant dispersion around a high-rise building","Abstract This article investigates the dispersion of airborne pollutants emitted from different locations near a high-rise building. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for simulating the wind flow field and the pollutant dispersion was developed and validated by wind tunnel data. Then the spreading of the pollutant emitted from different locations to a rectangular-shaped high-rise residential (HRR) building was numerically studied. The pollutant source location was set in a wide range of the position angle and distance between the source and the building. It was found that the pollutant concentration on the building decreases with an increase in the emission distance whereas the effect of the position angle is more complicated. Interestingly, there is a critical range of the position angle from which the emitted pollutants will not spread to the building in a significant way. The effect of the source location was linked to the wind flow field around the building, particularly with several major flows. The vertical distributions of the pollutant concentration on different faces were also investigated, and it was found that these are more affected by the vertical flow near each face. Finally, a mathematical model was developed to evaluate the pollutant concentration as a function of the emission distance and position angle. These findings are helpful to the understanding of the dispersion of airborne pollutants around high-rise buildings and the related hazard management in urban design.","59429c5352bfefa9ca3d1d161e46c34a39d901c4","True","Applied Mathematical Modelling","A Computational Fluid Dynamics|CFD|HRR","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-05-31","","10.1016/j.apm.2020.01.019","custom_license"

In this study, a scaled outdoor experiment was conducted to examine the interunit dispersion characteristics in consecutive two-dimensional street canyons. Tracer gas ( C O 2 ) was continuously released to simulate the pollutant dispersion routes between the rooms in street canyons. The wind velocity, wind direction, air temperature, and tracer gas concentrations were monitored simultaneously. Two important parameters, the air exchange rate and reentry ratio, were analyzed to reveal the ventilation performance and interunit dispersion of the rooms in the street canyons. Based on the real-time weather conditions, it was found that the ventilation performance of the source room varied according to the room location. The air exchange rate distribution of the leeward-side room was more stable than that of the windward side. The tracer gas was mainly transported in the vortex direction inside the street canyon, and the highest reentry ratio was observed at the room nearest to the source room along the transportation route. In addition, under real weather conditions, the rooms in the street canyon have a high probability of experiencing a high reentry ratio based on the maximum reentry ratio of each room. This study provides authentic airflow and pollutant dispersion information in the street canyons in an urban environment. The dataset of this experiment can be used to validate further numerical simulations.","4f50e0628130f198b5cf0cb3834aa3e66e292b8a","True","Building and Environment","CFD|two|Tracer|C O 2|Two","els-covid","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|ORG|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-15","","10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106673","custom_license"

The goal of this study was to predict the gaseous pollutant transmission using computational fluid dynamics based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and baseline k-ω turbulence equations. The results indicated that ventilation rates generally increased with increasing wind speeds if the effects of buoyancy and wind were not suppressed; however, the re-entry ratio representing the proportion of expelled air re-entering other floors and the corresponding risk of infection decreased. If the source of the virus was on a central floor, the risk of infection was the highest on the floors closest to the source. Different window types were also considered for determining their effectiveness in controlling cross-transmission and infection risk, depending on the source location and driving force (e.g., buoyancy and wind).","3e5cc874ecacef64da59d6a771939c385ff3710d","True","Building and Environment","six|Reynolds","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|GPE","Elsevier","2020-04-30","","10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106705","custom_license"

It is believed that active fractions of mannoproteins (AFMs) obtained through extraction and fractionation of yeast cell walls (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) may beneficially modulate the immune system. However, studies that have evaluated this component and the effects of ageing on the immune system of dogs are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the immunological effects of AFMs in adult and elderly dogs. Three extruded iso-nutrient experimental diets were formulated: without addition of AFM (T0); with AFM at 400 mg/kg (T400); and with AFM at 800 mg/kg (T800). Thirty-six beagle dogs were used, and six experimental treatments, resulting in combinations of age (adult and elderly) and diet (T0, T400, and T800), were evaluated. On days zero, 14, and 28, blood samples were obtained for leucocyte phenotyping and phagocytosis assays. On days zero and 28, a lymphoproliferation test, quantification of reactive oxygen (H2O2) and nitrogen (NO) intermediate production, evaluation of faecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) content, and a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity test (DCHT) were performed. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software. Repeated measure variance analyses were performed, and means were compared by the Tukey test. Values of P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant, and values of P ≤ 0.10 were considered tendencies. Dogs fed T400 tended to have higher neutrophilic phagocytic activity than dogs fed T800 (P = 0.073). Regarding reactive oxygen intermediates, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils from animals that were fed T400 had a tendency to produce more H2O2 than those from animals fed the control diet (P = 0.093). Elderly dogs, when compared to adult dogs, had lower absolute T and B lymphocyte counts, lower auxiliary T lymphocyte counts, and higher cytotoxic T lymphocyte counts (P < 0.05). A significant effect of diet, age, and time with saline inoculation was noted for the DCHT. There was no effect of diet or age on faecal IgA content in dogs. This study suggests beneficial effects of mannoproteins on the specific and nonspecific immune responses in adult and elderly dogs.","2b6ed90f4a98fc04c97fac3ba450f8ae76fb728f","True","Animal Feed Science and Technology","Three|AFM|T0|AFM|400|AFM|800|Thirty-six|six|T0|T400|days zero|14|28|days zero and 28|IgA|DCHT|SAS|Tukey|0.05|0.10|0.073|T400|0.05|DCHT|IgA","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|NORP|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|FAC|CARDINAL|NORP|FAC","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.114392","custom_license"

Thus, the development of novel anti-BVDV strategies are urgently needed. The nonstructural protein 5 (NS5B) of BVDV is essential for viral replication. Further, the camel single-domain antibody (nanobody) represents a promising antiviral approach with the advantages of small size, stable structure, high specificity and solubility, and the recognition of specific epitopes. However, no NS5B-specific nanobodies against BVDV have been reported. In this study, NS5B-specific nanobodies were isolated from a phage display library of variable domains of Camellidae heavy chain-only antibodies (VHHs). Further, an MDBK cell line stably expressing Nb1 was established to explore antiviral activity. Results showed that Nb1 could markedly suppress BVDV replication and interact with the BVDV NS5B protein. This suggests that nanobodies have potential for the development of novel antiviral drugs against BVDV infection.","57b1179e96db85fd18f30239d8370fe6c3d4c0c6","True","Veterinary Microbiology","5|NS5B|BVDV|NS5B|BVDV|NS5B|Camellidae|MDBK|BVDV NS5B","els-covid","","","31836380","CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108449","custom_license"

In this study, an original, highly virulent PEAV strain GDS04 was serially passaged in Vero cells. The virus titers and sizes of syncytia increased gradually with the cell passages. Newborn piglets were orally inoculated with PEAV P15, P67 and P100. Compared with P15 and P67, P100 resulted in only mild clinical signs and intestinal lesions in piglets. The virus shedding in feces and viral antigens in intestinal tract were markedly reduced in P100-inoculated piglets. Importantly, all P100-inoculated newborn piglets survived, indicating that P100 was an attenuated variant. Sequence analysis revealed that the virulent strain GDS04 had four, one, six and eleven amino acid differences in membrane, nucleocapsid, spike and ORF1ab proteins, respectively, from P100. Furthermore, more differences in the predicted three-dimensional structure of S protein between GDS04 and P100 were observed, indicating that these differences might be associated with the pathogenicity of PEAV.

In previous studies we found that the application of ultraviolet light C (UV-C) in liquid plasma that was inoculated with a variety of bacteria or viruses of importance in the swine industry can be considered as redundant safety steps because in general achieve around 4 logs reduction for most of these pathogens. However, the final validation of the UV-C light as safety feature should be conducted with commercial liquid plasma and using the pig bioassay model. As a first objective, the potential infectivity of a raw liquid plasma product collected from an abattoir was tested by means of a swine bioassay. We used Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), a ubiquitous virus that has been systematically detected by PCR in porcine plasma at abattoirs as selection criteria for commercial liquid plasma lot. As a second aim of the study, the effects of different doses of UV-C irradiation on the selected raw liquid plasma were assayed in the animal bioassay. Moreover, other swine infecting agents, including Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), were also determined in the original plasma and monitored in the inoculated animals. Pigs negative for PCV-2 and PRRSV genome and antibodies were allotted to one of five groups (6 to 8 pigs/ group) and injected intra-peritoneally with 10 mL of their assigned inoculum at 50 d of age. Negative control pigs (group 1) were injected with PBS. Positive control pigs (group 5) were injected with a PCV-2 inoculum. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were injected with liquid porcine plasma that had been subjected to 0 (raw plasma), 3000 or 9000 J/L UV-C irradiation, respectively. Group 2 pigs (0 J/L UV-C) got infection by PRRSV but no PCV-2 infection or seroconversion. However, one pig from group 2 seroconverted to Rotavirus A (RVA) and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) and three group 2 pigs seroconverted to Porcine parvovirus (PPV). Groups 1, 3 and 4 pigs showed no evidence of infection or seroconversion associated with the tested viruses or any other pathogens found in the liquid plasma before UV-C irradiation. Group 5 pigs developed PCV-2 infectivity as expected. UV-C irradiation of liquid plasma at 3000 and 9000 J/L was effective in preventing PRRSV and other pathogens transmission. Moreover, raw liquid plasma was non-infectious for PCV-2 in naïve pigs.","ce07b272168e9fb3c3cfce0af711f2d8aaef158e","True","Veterinary Microbiology","around 4|first|Porcine|2|PCV-2|second|Porcine|PRRSV|Pigs|PCV-2|PRRSV|one|five|6|10 mL|50|1|PBS|5|PCV-2|Groups 2|3|4|0|3000|9000|J/L UV-C|2|0 J/L UV-C|PRRSV|one|2|Rotavirus A|RVA|Hepatitis|three|2|Porcine|PPV|Groups|3|4|5|3000|9000 J/L|PRRSV|PCV-2","els-covid","","","31753544","CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|FAC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108450","custom_license"

HNSCC can be broadly divided into human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative cancers and HPV-positive cancers where HPV is the causative agent. Previous studies in FOSCC have used both species-specific and species-nonspecific PCR primers that may be insensitive to the detection of PVs and other viruses that may be divergent from known sequences. ViroCap is a targeted capture and next generation sequencing tool that was designed to identify all known vertebrate DNA and RNA viruses. In this study we used a metagenomic approach using ViroCap for DNA viruses in 20 FOSCC, 9 normal feline oral mucosal, and 8 suspected PV positive control samples. We tested the hypothesis that viruses would be enriched in FOSCC compared to normal oral mucosa. The virome of the FOSCC and normal feline oral mucosa consisted of feline foamy virus in 7/20 and 2/9 (35% and 22%), feline torque teno virus in 2/20 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), alphaherpesvirus in 2/10 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), FIV (0% and 22%), Epstein-Barr virus in 1/20 and 0/9 (5% and 0%) and feline papillomavirus in 1/20 and 0/9 samples (5% and 0% respectively). Felis catus papillomavirus-3 was found in 1 of 20 FOSCC samples. A virus was not associated consistently with FOSCC. If PVs have a role in FOSCC it is at most a supplementary or uncommon role. FOSCC appears most closely related to HPV-negative HNSCC. Future research on FOSCC should focus on identifying genetic and environmental causes.","ea800dcdcf09ab648a3229d2f1e02159877a4f53","True","Veterinary Microbiology","Feline|FOSCC|HNSCC|HNSCC|HPV|HPV|FOSCC|ViroCap|RNA|ViroCap|20|FOSCC|9|feline|8|PV|FOSCC|FOSCC|feline|feline|7/20|2/9|35% and 22%|2/20|0/9|10% and 0%|2/10|0/9|10% and 0%|FIV|0% and 22%|Epstein|Barr|1/20|0/9|5%|0%|1/20|0/9|5%|0%|Felis|papillomavirus-3|1|20|FOSCC|FOSCC|FOSCC|FOSCC|HPV|HNSCC|FOSCC","els-covid","","","31902496","DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|NORP|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108491","custom_license"

We examined the pathogenic effects of the viruses in chicken embryos and the size and morphology of the virus particles, performed phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene and complete genomic sequences, and examined the antibody responses against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The results suggested that the viruses I0623/17 and I0710/17 were avian coronaviruses and were identified as pheasant coronaviruses (PhCoV), with greatest similarity to IBV. Further investigations of the antigenicity, complete genome organization, substitutions in multiple genes, and viral pathogenicity, replication, and shedding in chickens and pheasants showed obvious differences between PhCoV and IBV in terms of antigenicity, and viral pathogenicity, replication, and shedding in chickens and pheasants. The close genetic relationship, but obvious differences between PhCoVs and IBVs suggested the IBVs could be the ancestors of PhCoVs, and that PhCoVs isolated from different outbreaks may have evolved independently from IBVs circulating in the specific region by adaption in pheasants. This hypothesis was supported by analysis of the S1 gene fragments of the two PhCoVs isolated in the current study, as well as PhCoVs isolated in the UK and selected IBV strains. Such analyses indicated different evolution patterns and different tissue tropisms between PhCoVs isolated in different outbreaks. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis by studying the complete genomic sequences of PhCoVs from different outbreaks and the pathogenicity of IBVs in pheasants to compare and clarify the relationships between PhCoVs and IBVs.","4e17c8d64641ade812c9fa55a8b18ba5ed472204","True","Veterinary Microbiology","Two|2017|Shandong|Anhui|China|S1|IBV|PhCoV|IBV|PhCoV|IBV|PhCoVs|S1|two|UK|IBV","els-covid","","","31902509","CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108513","custom_license"
"Han, Xuejiao; Bertzbach, Luca D.; Veit, Michael","Mimicking the passage of avian influenza viruses through the gastrointestinal tract of chickens","Abstract In contrast to human influenza viruses that replicate in the respiratory tract and are airborne transmitted, avian viruses also replicate in gut epithelial cells and are transmitted via the fecal-oral route. On this route, the virus is exposed to destructive fluids of the digestive tract, which are acidic and contain the proteases pepsin (gizzard) or chymotrypsin and trypsin (intestine). Only the latter enzyme activates virus by cleaving hemagglutinin (HA) into HA1 and HA2 subunits. We mimicked the passage of viruses through the gastrointestinal tract by treating them with digestive fluids from chicken and determined titers and integrity of HA by western-blot. Gizzard fluid completely inactivated virions and degrades HA even at a high dilution, but only if the pH was kept acidic. If the fluid is diluted with neutral buffer (mimicking virus uptake with seawater) particles were more resistant. Virions containing an uncleaved HA were even activated suggesting that gastric juice contains a trypsin-like protease. Undiluted intestinal fluid inactivated particles and destroyed HA, but diluted fluid activated virions. A virus isolated from the duck´s intestine is more tolerant against intestinal fluid compared to fowl plague virus suggesting that the former is better adapted to grow in the intestine. We also demonstrate that influenza viruses replicate to high titers in a novel chicken epithelial gut cell line. While viruses with a monobasic HA cleavage site require addition of trypsin, these cells effectively process HA with a polybasic cleavage site, which could be blocked with an inhibitor of the cellular furin protease.","286b5527a5e07dc7ff214e6c2b01dfffc72fb805","True","Veterinary Microbiology","Gizzard|HA","els-covid","","","31767100","ORG|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108462","custom_license"

S100A9 is a damage-associated molecular pattern of the S100 protein family. Here, we found that PRRSV infection stimulated S100A9 expression in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and Marc-145 cells. S100A9 inhibited PRRSV replication via cellular Ca2+ dependent manner. The viral nucleocapsid (N) protein co-localized with S100A9 in the cytoplasm, and directly interacted at amino acid 78 of S100A9 and amino acids 36–37 of N protein.

Immunohistochemistry analysis of kidney sections of FeMV RNA positive cats revealed immunoreactivity within epithelial cells of renal tubuli and inflammatory cells. However, statistically significant association between FeMV and renal damages, including TIN, was not demonstrated (p= 0.0695, Fisher exact test). By virus histochemistry performed with FeMV-negative feline tissues and a FeMV isolate, tropism for different cellular types such as inflammatory cells residing in blood vessels of kidney and brain, airway epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and to a lesser extent, the central nervous system, was demonstrated. Additional studies are warranted in order to establish viral tropism and immune response during the early phases of infection and to disentangle the role of FeMV in co-infection processes.","ddbe321178b25ba2cc1f1f9b3a3e87a8724f2380","True","Veterinary Microbiology","Feline|FeMV|first|less than a decade ago|FeMV|TIN|FeMV|127|two|Italian|Abruzzi|Emilia-Romagna|69|three|colonies|TIN|35|colonies|31.8%|CI|95%|22.1–43.6|8.66%|CI|95%|FeMV Abs|two|FeMV|1|FeMV|2|FeMV RNA|FeMV|TIN|0.0695|FeMV|FeMV|FeMV","els-covid","","","31902482","DATE|ORG|ORDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|LOC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108484","custom_license"

Restrictions due to notifiable epizootics complicate the exchange of samples in surveillance studies and suggest that laboratory capacities should be established domestically. Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) causes mainly enteric disease in cattle. Spillover to small ruminants is possible. Here we established BCoV serology based on a recombinant immunofluorescence assay for cattle, goats and sheep, and studied the seroprevalence of BCoV in these species in four different locations in the Greater Accra, Volta, Upper East, and Northern provinces of Ghana. The whole sampling and testing was organized and conducted by a veterinary school in Kumasi, Ashanti Region of Ghana. Among sampled sheep (n = 102), goats (n = 66), and cattle (n = 1495), the seroprevalence rates were 25.8 %, 43.1 % and 55.8 %. For cattle, seroprevalence was significantly higher on larger farms (82.2 % vs 17.8 %, comparing farms with >50 or <50 animals; p = 0.027). Highest prevalence was seen in the Northern province with dry climate, but no significant trend following the north-south gradient of sampling sites was detected. Our study identifies a considerable seroprevalence for BCoV in Ghana and provides further support for the spillover of BCoV to small ruminants in settings with mixed husbandry and limited separation between species.","a85682aca36d1cf089dc70545836c4a2485c93ee","True","Veterinary Microbiology","Saharan Africa|Coronavirus|BCoV|BCoV|BCoV|four|the Greater Accra|Volta|Upper East|Northern|Ghana|Kumasi|Ashanti Region of Ghana|102|66|1495|25.8 %|43.1 %|55.8 %|82.2 %|17.8 %|50|50|0.027|Highest|Northern|BCoV|Ghana|BCoV","els-covid","","","31928696","GPE|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|LOC|GPE|LOC|NORP|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|LOC|PERSON|GPE|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108544","custom_license"

Here, an IBV strain, designated as ck/CH/LJX/2017/07 (referred as JX17) was isolated from chicken vaccinated with H120 and 4/91 in Jiangxi, China, in 2017. Sequence analysis reveals of the S1 gene of JX17 the highest nucleotide identity of 98.15% with that of GI-7 genotype TW2575/98 strain. Furthermore, whole genome analysis among JX17 and other 18 IBV strains demonstrates that JX17 has the highest nucleotide identity of 95.94% with GI-19 genotype YX10 strain. Among all genes of JX17 except the S1 gene, the N gene and 3’ UTR have the highest identity to GI-13 genotype 4/91 strain and the rest genes are the most identical to GI-19 genotype YX10 strain. Analyzed by the RDP and SimPlot, the recombination of JX17 strain was shown to occur in regions which include 5’-terminal S1 gene (20,344 to 22,447 nt), most N gene and 3’ UTR (26,163 to 27,648 nt). The pathogenicity study shows that JX17 is a natural low virulent IBV variant which caused respiratory symptoms but no death. Taken together, these results indicate that IBV strains continue to evolve through genetic recombination and three prevalent genotypes in China including QX, TW and 4/91 have started to recombine.","96473dd2c6f3374c32b63349a66b38a05788a1ac","True","Veterinary Microbiology","China|IBV|IBV|LJX/2017/07|Jiangxi|China|2017|S1|98.15%|GI-7|18|IBV|95.94%|YX10|3’|UTR|GI-13|4/91|GI-19|YX10|SimPlot|5’-terminal S1|20,344|22,447|3’|UTR|26,163|27,648|IBV|IBV|three|China|QX|TW|4/91","els-covid","","","32122588","GPE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108579","custom_license"
"Shi, Tianyu; Long, Ting; Pan, Yaohui; Zhang, Wensi; Dong, Chao; Yin, Qiuju","Effects of asymptomatic infection on the dynamical interplay between behavior and disease transmission in multiplex networks","Abstract Multiplex network theory is widely introduced to deepen the understanding of the dynamical interplay between self-protective behavior and epidemic spreading. Most of the existing studies assumed that all infected individuals can transmit disease- related information or can be perceived by their neighbors. However, owing to lack of distinct symptoms for patients in the initial stage of infection, the disease information cannot be transmitted in the population, which may lead to the wrong perception of infection risk and inappropriate behavior response. In this work, we divide infected individuals into Exposed-state (without obvious clinical symptoms) individuals and Infected-state (with evident clinical symptoms) individuals, both of whom can spread disease, but only Infected-state individuals can diffuse disease information. Then, in this work we establish UAU-SEIS (Unaware–Aware–Unaware–Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Susceptible) model in multiplex networks and analyze the effect of asymptomatic infection and the isolation of Infected-state individuals on the density of infection and the epidemic threshold. Furthermore, we extend the UAU-SEIS model by taking the individual heterogeneity into consideration. Combined Markov chain approach and Monte-Carlo Simulations, we find that asymptomatic infection has an effect on the density of infected individuals and the epidemic threshold, and the extent of the effect is influenced by whether Infected-state individuals are isolated or treated. In addition, results show that the individual heterogeneity can lower the density of infected individuals, but cannot enhance the epidemic threshold.","4c4aa83e7c5b990b8b14fa2f9cf017f3f5b5ffb7","True","Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","Multiplex|Exposed|UAU-SEIS (Unaware–|Markov|Monte-Carlo Simulations","els-covid","","","","NORP|GPE|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-15","","10.1016/j.physa.2019.04.266","custom_license"

To investigate the scenario, a dynamic error based method, Z-type control is applied in an SI type disease model with the aim of achieving a predetermined disease prevalence. The controlled system is designed by introducing a new compartment (the population in an infection-free region) in the uncontrolled system to capture the removal of susceptible population from the infected region to an infection free region. By performing numerical simulations, our study shows that using Z-control mechanism, the removal of susceptible to an infection free region can effectively achieve a predetermined disease prevalence. The removal rates required for achieving a specific reduction in infected population for different levels of disease endemicity are quantified. Furthermore, the global sensitivity analysis (PRCC) is also performed to have a more clear insights on the correlations of the control parameter with the model parameters.","f87a35420ee8d9c9c19c5279d4b803130eadc6fe","True","Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","SI","els-covid","","","","ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-19","","10.1016/j.physa.2019.123846","custom_license"

Aims This review article documents and critically assesses, for the first time; up to date categorized information about C. serrata including its reported pharmacological activities, cultural uses, active compounds, and botanical description. Materials and method s: All provided information about C. serrata was collected using the electronic databases (e.g. Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Springer Link), books (e.g. Trees of Pakistan and Herbalism, Phytochemistry, and Ethnopharmacology) and thesis. Results Qualitative and quantitative phytochemical studies on C. serrata revealed the presence of important chemical constituents such as; flavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, and cardiac glycosides. The phytochemicals showed various in vitro activities like antioxidant, anti-infective, antiglycation, cytotoxic activities. Major areas of research conducted on C. serrata are its antioxidant and anti-infective activities. Few historical uses of C. serrata are supported by modern in vitro pharmacological studies such as; antidiarrheal, antidiabetic, and leishmanicidal activity. Conclusion There were convincing evidence in in vitro studies supporting C. serrata antioxidant, anti-infective, anti-diabetic, anti-glycating, and cytotoxic activities. Nevertheless, all reported pharmacological activities were carried out in vitro and a gap in research i.e. preclinical and clinical investigation still exists. The authors emphasize the need for future in-depth research and clinical trials to investigate C. serrata pharmacological activity, clinical efficacy and safety. The potential chemical compounds with suggestive classes may need to be isolated and pharmacological activities must be established for these compounds. The plant has very limited information about pharmacological activities and the data available for supportive cultural uses needs proper validation.","258f2880d2fdcb0a006c1c21243838370ed9b334","True","Journal of Ethnopharmacology","Cedrela|Royle|C.|first|C.|C.|Google Scholar|Web of Science|Scopus|PubMed|Science Direct and Springer Link|Trees of Pakistan|Herbalism, Phytochemistry|Results Qualitative|C.|C.|C.|C.|C.","els-covid","","","31494199","ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-10","","10.1016/j.jep.2019.112206","custom_license"

This knowledge was neglected in European veterinary medicine for decades but kept alive by farmers. Emergence of multidrug resistant bacterial strains requires a severely restricted use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine. We conducted a survey on the ethnoveterinary knowledge of farmers in the bilingual (French and German speaking) Western region of Switzerland, namely the cantons of Fribourg, Neuchâtel and Jura, and in the French speaking part of the canton of Bern. Aim of the study To find out whether differences exist in plants used by farmers in French speaking and bilingual regions of Switzerland as compared to our earlier studies conducted in Switzerland. Additional focus was on plants that are used in diseases which commonly are treated with antimicrobials, on plants used in skin afflictions, and on plants used in animal species such as horses, for which the range of veterinary medicinal products is limited. Material and methods We conducted in 2015 semistructured interviews with 62 dialog partners, mainly cattle keeping farmers but also 18 horse keeping farmers. Of these, 41 were native French (FNS) and 21 native German speakers (GNS). Detailed information about homemade herbal remedies (plant species, plant part, manufacturing process) and the corresponding use reports (target animal species, category of use, route of administration, dosage, source of knowledge, frequency of use, last time of use and farmers satisfaction) were collected. Results A total of 345 homemade remedies were reported, of which 240 contained only one plant species (Homemade Single Species Herbal Remedy Reports; HSHR). A total of 289 use reports (UR) were mentioned for the 240 HSHR, and they comprised 77 plant species belonging to 41 botanical families. Of these, 35 plant species were solely reported from FNS, 20 from GNS, and 22 from both. Taking into account earlier ethnoveterinary studies conducted in Switzerland only 10 (FNS) and 6 (GNS) plant species connected with 7% of FNS and GNS UR respectively were “unique” to the respective language group. The majority of the UR (219) was for treatment of cattle, while 38 UR were intended to treat horses. The most UR were for treatment of gastrointestinal and skin diseases. The most frequently mentioned plants were Linum usitatissimum L., Coffea L., Matricaria chamomilla L., Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, and Quercus robur L. for gastrointestinal diseases, and Calendula officinalis L., Hypericum perforatum L. and Sanicula europaea L. for skin afflictions. Conclusion No clear differences were found between the medicinal plants used by French native speakers and German native speakers. Several of the reported plants seem to be justified to widen the spectrum of veterinary therapeutic options in gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders in cattle and horses, and to reduce, at least to a certain degree, the need for antibiotic treatments. Our findings may help to strengthen the role of medicinal plants in veterinary research and practice, and to consider them as a further measure in official strategies for lowering the use of antibiotics.","88c6892230189edaea262895b14a15b1c6032041","True","Journal of Ethnopharmacology","European|decades|French|German|Switzerland|Fribourg|Neuchâtel|Jura|French|Bern|French|Switzerland|Switzerland|2015|62|18|41|French|21|native German|GNS|345|240|only one|Homemade Single Species|Herbal Remedy Reports|289|UR|240|77|41|35|FNS|20|GNS|22|Switzerland|only 10|6|GNS|7%|FNS|GNS UR|UR|219|38|UR|UR|Linum|L.|Coffea L.|Matricaria|L.|Camellia|L.)

JZ-1 also has preventive and therapeutic effects on Trichomonas vaginitis, Candida albicans vaginitis and GH in vitro and in vivo experiments. Aim of study The effect and mechanism of JZ-1 on anti-herpes simplex virus type 2(HSV-2) in vitro focusing on adhesion and penetration stages were investigated. Materials and methods A model of HSV-2 infection of VK2/E6E7 was developed. In order to explore JZ-1's anti-HSV-2 effect in vitro, cell morphology, ultrastructural pathology, cell viability and expression of viral glycoprotein D (gD) were assessed at 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h of JZ-1 treatment. Then we measured the exact time required for adhesion and penetration of HSV-2 into VK2/E6E7 among a series of times at room temperature and under temperature control techniques. We treated VK2/E6E7 with JZ-1, penciclovir, or berberine and explored the mechanism of JZ-1 in blocking HSV-2 adhesion and penetration of host cells by assessing the cell ultrastructural pathology, viability, viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, ICP5, and ICP4 and host cell proteins HVEM, Nectin-1, and Nectin-2. Results HSV-2 can fully adhere and penetrate into VK/E6E7 within 5 mins at room temperature while it takes 60mins under temperature control techniques. JZ-1 and penciclovir showed significant anti-HSV-2 effects, with improved host cell morphologies and increased host cell viabilities observed after treatment for 24 h. The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 can be detected after treatment for 6 h while that of penciclovir was not obvious until treatment for 12 h. JZ-1 showed distinct effect on HSV-2 adhesion and penetration stages by significantly reducing the expression of viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, ICP5, and ICP4, improving cell morphology and increasing cell viability. However, these effects were not exerted via downregulated expression of membrane fusion-related proteins such as HVEM, Nectin-1, or Nectin-2. The specific anti-HSV-2 mechanism of JZ-1 need to be further explored. Conclusion The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 was superior to that of penciclovir and berberine in vitro, and was mainly mediated by enhancing host cell defense and blocking adhesion and penetration of HSV-2.","5f3fa64c7e7bf6e03f3628adbacd36676e8affa4","True","Journal of Ethnopharmacology","The Chinese Herbal Prescription JieZe-1(JZ-1|Yihuang Decoction|the 12th year|Kangxi|Qing Dynasty|Genital Herpes|GH|JZ-1|Candida|GH|JZ-1|VK2/E6E7|JZ-1|6|12|18|24|JZ-1|VK2/E6E7|VK2/E6E7|JZ-1|JZ-1|HSV-2|VP16|ICP5|ICP4|HVEM|Nectin-1|Nectin-2|VK|5 mins|JZ-1|24|JZ-1|6|12|JZ-1|HSV-2|VP16|ICP5|ICP4|HVEM|Nectin-1|Nectin-2|JZ-1|JZ-1|HSV-2","els-covid","","","31743766","ORG|ORG|DATE|GPE|DATE|ORG|PERSON|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|DATE|DATE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|QUANTITY|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|DATE|DATE|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-01","","10.1016/j.jep.2019.112405","custom_license"

For centuries, the herb has been employed in clinical practice for treatment of virus infection and inflammation. However, its active ingredients remain unclear. Aim of the study In the present study, the anti-influenza virus activity of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin, the Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products, was firstly evaluated in vitro and in ovo and their mechanism of action was investigated. Materials and methods Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were isolated from Isatidis Radix by chiral separation. In vitro and in ovo evaluations were performed on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and embryonated eggs respectively, both using protocols including prevention, treatment and virus neutralization. Hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assays were performed for further understanding of the antiviral mechanism. Results Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products all exhibited dose-dependent inhibition effect against influenza A virus (H1N1) without toxicity. The antiviral potency of the components was in the order of progoitrin > goitrin > epigoitrin > epiprogoitrin. The attachment of the constituents to the viral envelope conduced to the mechanism of their antiviral action without disturbing viral adsorption or budding.

Currently, this TCM could treat various clinical inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and psoriasis, however, the bioactive components of Qing Dai are unknown clearly. Aim of the study To isolate and identify the anti-IL-17A components of Qing Dai. Materials and methods Silica, RP-18 gels, and size exclusion resin were used for column chromatography to isolate the pure compounds. The structures of isolates were elucidated by NMR, MS, UV, IR spectra, and optical rotation. IL-17A protein and gene expressions were also evaluated in the Th17 cell model and luciferase reporter assay, respectively. Results Two indole alkaloids, including one new indigodole D and cephalandole B, were isolated from Qing Dai. Indigodole D could inhibit IL-17A protein production during the Th17 polarization (EC50: 2.16 μg/mL) or after the polarization (EC50: 5.99 μg/mL) without cytotoxicity toward Th17 cells.

Aim of the study Genital herpes is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) worldwide and is mainly caused by herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2). Current therapies can relieve symptoms in patients but do not cure or prevent the spread of the virus. This study was designed to investigate the effect of JZ-1 on HSV-2 infection and its mechanism, which is based on autophagy induction, to provide new ideas and a basis for the study of antiviral drugs. Materials and methods Evaluation of the antiviral activity of JZ-1 was conducted by MTT assay and western blotting. Then, Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, observations through transmission electron microscopy and experiments with the recombinant lentivirus vector mRFP-GFP-LC3B were used to monitor autophagic flux in VK2/E6E7 cells. To explore the mechanism by which JZ-1 regulates autophagy, western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to determine the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins and to detect changes in critical molecules in the pathway after the application of a PI3K inhibitor. Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, namely, IL-6, IFN-α, IFN-β and TNF-α, were measured with qRT-PCR. Results HSV-2 infection inhibited autophagy in the VK2/E6E7 cells. Further study revealed that the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway induced by HSV-2 infection may result in the blocked autophagic flux and inhibited autophagosome and autolysosome formation. JZ-1 exhibited significant antiviral activity in the VK2/E6E7 cells, which showed increased cell vitality and reduced viral protein expression, namely, earliest virus-specific infected cell polypeptides 5 (ICP5) and glycoprotein D (gD). We found that JZ-1 treatment inhibited the upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins and promoted autophagy to combat HSV-2 infection, while PI3K inhibitor pretreatment prevented the enhanced autophagy induced by JZ-1. Moreover, JZ-1 attenuated the increase in inflammatory cytokines that had been induced HSV-2 infection. Conclusion Our results showed that JZ-1 protects against HSV-2 infection, and this beneficial effect may be mediated by inducing autophagy via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling axis.","01ceb817f8665ed0047c4675e04b67b199e18832","True","Journal of Ethnopharmacology","Chinese|JieZe-1|JZ-1|Yihuang Tang|first|Fu Qingzhu Nvke|Qing Dynasty|Shan Fu|JZ-1|Tongji Hospital|many years|JZ-1|Candida|Trichomonas|Ureaplasma|Genital|STDs|JZ-1|JZ-1|MTT|Western|VK2/E6E7|JZ-1|3-kinase|IL-6|IFN-α|IFN-β|TNF-α|VK2/E6E7|VK2/E6E7|5|D (gD|JZ-1|Akt|JZ-1|JZ-1|JZ-1|Akt","els-covid","","","","NORP|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORDINAL|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|DATE|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|PERSON|NORP|PERSON|PERSON|DATE|DATE|PERSON|NORP|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-20","","10.1016/j.jep.2020.112611","custom_license"
"Le Turnier, P.; Leport, C.; Martin, P.; Jadand, C.; Hoen, B.; Guégan, J.-F.","Multi-sectorial research is paramount for preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases","Abstract The social, economic and political consequences of emerging infectious disease (EID) may escape the sphere in which they first arise. In recent years, many EIDs have revealed the close links between human, animal and plant health, highlighting the need for multi-scale, multisectorial EID management. Human beings play a dual role in EID because they can promote their development through numerous human-environment interfaces and expanding international trade. On the other hand, their ability to analyze, interpret and act on the determinants of EID allows them to access the expertise necessary to control these EIDs. This expertise must be constantly adapted to remain relevant as the EID evolves, particularly in its virulence or transmission channels. Flexibility should become an inherent part of the expertise-based decision-making process even if it means going backwards. A certain degree of transparency and feedback to citizens is necessary for the acceptability of political decisions basing on expertise. A key step in the management of EID is the appropriate management of the early signal of infectious emergence. This step combines multidisciplinary skills allowing access to the best pathway for containing EID by implementing early countermeasures adapted to the situation. New digital technologies could significantly improve this early detection phase. Finally, experts have a fundamental role to play because they are located at the interface between operational actors and decision-makers, which allows multidirectional feedback, ideally in real time, between professional actors and decision makers. To combat current and future EIDs, expertise should be based on a multi-sectorial approach, promotion of collegiality and continuously adaptation to the evolving nature of EIDs.","2f9310e0dea7e630a250e5ff4dcfbc6314612249","True","Revue d'Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique","first|recent years|EID|EID|EID|EID|EID|EID","els-covid","","","","ORDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-04-30","","10.1016/j.respe.2019.09.009","custom_license"

We aimed to assess the usefulness of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for respiratory pathogens, in combination with standard bacteriological investigations, in febrile ACS adult patients presenting with major SCD. Methods We performed a prospective, monocentric, observational study of 61 SCD adults presenting with febrile ACS from February 2015 to April 2016. Systematic blood, urine, and respiratory specimens were collected, before antibiotic initiation, for culture, urinary antigen tests, serology, and NAAT for respiratory pathogens. Results A pathogen was detected in 12 febrile ACS (19.7%): four viruses (6.6%) (Rhinovirus; Influenza A/B), seven bacteria (11.4%) (S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae), one mixed infection (1.6%) (S. aureus and Influenza B). NAAT only detected L. pneumophila in one case (serogroup 2). Apart from a significantly shorter antibiotic therapy duration (6.1 vs. 7.8 days, P =0.045), no difference was observed between undocumented and microbiologically-documented febrile ACS. Conclusion Using NAAT for the detection of respiratory pathogens in adults presenting with SCD slightly improved the microbiological diagnostic of febrile ACS, although respiratory infections are not the main etiological factor.","0f708595e4628dc58164414bd6acf9f9df6c0ba8","True","Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses","ACS|CAP|SCD|NAAT|ACS|SCD|61|SCD|ACS|February 2015|April 2016|NAAT|12|ACS|19.7%|four|6.6%|Influenza|A/B)|seven|11.4%|S.|K. pneumoniae|L.|M. pneumoniae|one|1.6%|S.|Influenza|NAAT|L.|one|2|6.1|7.8 days|0.045|ACS|NAAT|SCD|ACS","els-covid","","","31088757","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERSON|NORP|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.medmal.2019.04.391","custom_license"

The total flavonoids of Sophora tonkinensis (TFST) were inactive on the complement system but showed obvious anticomplement activity after incubated with human intestinal bacteria in vitro. In order to discover the metabolic activation of TFST by intestinal flora, the constituents of TFST and its metabolites were identified by UPLC-ESI-LTQ/MS. Their anticomplement activities were evaluated through the classical and alternative pathway. As a result, eighteen flavonoids were identified, including seven flavonoid glycosides, five aglycones and six isoprenylated flavonoids. All the glycosides (daidzein-4′-glucoside-rhamnoside, sophorabioside, rutin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, ononin, trifolirhizin) were metabolized into their corresponding aglycones in different extent by human intestinal bacteria, resulting in the contents of the five aglycones were highly increased in 24 h. However, no changes have occurred on the six isoprenylated flavonoids. Interestingly, three aglycones (quercetin, formononetin and maackiain) had significantly more potent anticomplement activities than their prototype glycosides. The results indicated that the enhancement of TFST anticomplement activity was attributed to the active aglycones, especially formononetin and quercetin, produced by human intestinal bacteria. These aglycones are likely to be among the potential active components of S. tonkinensis for its inhibiting inflammation effects.","02ff1656fdbbbf0c46c26b26443d818d88366102","True","Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis","Chinese|Sophora|UPLC|ESI|eighteen|seven|five|six|five|24|six|three","els-covid","","","32092632","NORP|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-05-30","","10.1016/j.jpba.2020.113176","custom_license"

Seghal","Culture-dependent and metagenomic analysis of lesser horseshoe bats’ gut microbiome revealing unique bacterial diversity and signatures of potential human pathogens","Abstract Bats are highly diverse and ecologically important mammals. They harbor various bacteria, viruses, and fungal communities that are either beneficial or potentially pathogenic. Extensive metagenomic studies in bats are limited, particularly for the gut, and to date, there are no reports on the bacterial diversity of Rhinolophus monoceros from Meghalaya, India. There are limited studies on the isolation of potential harmful or beneficial bacteria and their interactions with the environment through culture-dependent approaches. Therefore, high-throughput screening was used to understand the population structure, genetic diversity, and ecological role of the microorganisms. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA marker for gene mapping showed that the gut samples constitute a diverse group of bacteria that is dominated by Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes. The bacterial genera Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium were also observed in the Illumina dataset. Illumina sequencing revealed eight bacterial phyla composed of 112 genera. The metagenomic analysis of the OTUs from the gut revealed diverse bacterial communities as well as zoonotic and human pathogens. There were differences in the bacterial communities between the two methods used in this study, which could be related to host specificity, diet, and habitat. The culture-dependent technique resulted in the isolation of 35 bacterial isolates, of which Bacillus cereus and B. anthracis are well-known bacterial pathogens that show virulent traits including hemolytic and proteolytic activities. Pseudomonas stutzeri is an opportunistic human pathogen that was also isolated and showed similar traits. Antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed on all 35 isolates, and different antibiotics were used for Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The result showed that some isolates are resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin G and Cefoxitin. This report on gut bacterial communities could attract interest in the possibility of isolating and characterizing bacteria for the production of antibiotics, enzymes, plant growth promoters, and probiotics. However, the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria that may impose health hazards cannot be ignored and needs to be studied further.","9bfa842ad5cc933a0642dff4fda8e56f64aa676a","True","Microbial Pathogenesis","Abstract Bats|Rhinolophus|Meghalaya|India|Proteobacteria|Firmicutes|Corynebacterium|Mycobacterium|Illumina|Illumina|eight|112|two|35|B.|Antibiotic|35|Gram|Cefoxitin","els-covid","","","31473248","ORG|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP|PRODUCT|GPE|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|NORP|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.micpath.2019.103675","custom_license"

They are widespread both in dairy and beef cattle throughout the world and causing huge economic losses. The diagnosis of these agents is very difficult due to non-specific nature of lesions and the involvement of some intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. We performed postmortem of 45 calves, which was below three months of age. Out of 45 necropscid calves, three (6.66%) cases were positive for BRoV and four (8.88%) cases were found positive for BCoV, screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further RT-PCR positive cases were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in paraffin-embedded intestinal tissue sections. Three cases of enteritis caused by BRoV showed the hallmark lesions of the shortening and fusion of villi, denudation and infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria. The BRoV antigen distribution was prominent within the lining epithelium of the villi, peyer's patches in the ileum and strong immunoreactions in the lymphocytes and some macrophages of the mesenteric lymph nodes. Four cases in which BCoV was detected, grossly lesions characterized by colonic mucosa covered with thick, fibrinous and diphtheritic membrane. Histopathologically, jejunum showed skipping lesion of micro-abscesses in crypts. The BCoV antigen distribution was prominent within the necrotic crypts in the jejunum and cryptic micro-abscesses in the colon and ileum. It is the first report of BRoV and BCoV antigen demonstration in the jejunum, colon, ileum, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes of naturally infected calves from India by using IHC.","239f21cba5b6c2861ef65214421a5b333576b8c8","True","Microbial Pathogenesis","BRoV|BCoV|45|three months of age|45|three (6.66%|BRoV|four|8.88%|BCoV|RT-PCR|RT-PCR|IHC|Three|BRoV|BRoV|Four|BCoV|BCoV|first|BRoV|BCoV|Peyer|India|IHC","els-covid","","","31639467","LOC|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|LOC|LOC|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|ORDINAL|LOC|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.micpath.2019.103814","custom_license"

As a respiratory disease, influenza A virus (IAV) infection can lead to hepatitis, but the mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of hepatitis by establishing a model for infected mice for three different subtypes of respiratory IAVs (H1N1, H5N1, and H7N2). Histological analysis was performed, and results showed increase serum aminotransferase (ALT and AST) levels and evident liver injury on days 3 and 7, especially on day 5 post infection. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results indicated a wide distribution of IAV's positive signals in the liver of infected mice. Real-time PCR results further revealed a similar viral titer to IHC that presented a remarkedly positive correlation with histology injury.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important intracellular regulators and play a pivotal role in viral infections. In previous studies, we have revealed that IBV infection caused a significant down-regulation of gga-miR-30d expression in chicken kidneys. In present study, we investigated the role of gga-miR-30d in the process of IBV infection of HD11 cell line in vitro. By transfecting the mimics and inhibitor of gga-miR-30d, it was found that overexpressed gga-miR-30d inhibited IBV replication. Contrarily, low-expressed gga-miR-30d promoted IBV replication. In addition, dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that ubiquitin-specific protease 47 (USP47), a deubiquitinase-encoding gene, was a target for gga-miR-30d.

Keith; Foster, James A.; Uversky, Vladimir N.","Nipah shell disorder, modes of infection, and virulence","Abstract The Nipah Virus (NiV) was first isolated during a 1998–9 outbreak in Malaysia. The outbreak initially infected farm pigs and then moved to humans from pigs with a case-fatality rate (CFR) of about 40%. After 2001, regular outbreaks occurred with higher CFRs (~71%, 2001–5, ~93%, 2008–12). The spread arose from drinking virus-laden palm date sap and human-to-human transmission. Intrinsic disorder analysis revealed strong correlation between the percentage of disorder in the N protein and CFR (Regression: r2 = 0.93, p < 0.01, ANOVA: p < 0.01). Distinct disorder and, therefore, genetic differences can be found in all three group of strains. The fact that the transmission modes of the Malaysia strain are different from those of the Bangladesh strains suggests that the correlations may also be linked to the modes of viral transmission. Analysis of the NiV and related viruses suggests links between modes of transmission and disorder of not just the N protein but, also, of M shell protein. The links among shell disorder, transmission modes, and virulence suggest mechanisms by which viruses are attenuated as they passed through different cell hosts from different animal species. These have implications for development of vaccines and epidemiological molecular analytical tools to contain outbreaks.","21fb1a4fc6603d98e91e068c28711b06dd39dedd","True","Microbial Pathogenesis","NiV|first|1998–9|Malaysia|about 40%|2001|2001–5|2008–12|Intrinsic|CFR (Regression: r2|0.93|0.01|ANOVA|0.01|Distinct|three|Malaysia|Bangladesh|NiV","els-covid","","","31940461","ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE","Elsevier","2020-04-30","","10.1016/j.micpath.2020.103976","custom_license"

Materials and methods This was a single-center prospective randomized study. All patients undergoing FOB-guided nasal tracheal intubation were randomized to bag-valve-mask ventilation or NIV for preoxygenation followed by intubation. The NIV group were intubated through a sealed hole in a specially designed face mask during continuous NIV support with 100% oxygen. Control patients were intubated with removal of the mask and no ventilatory support. Results We enrolled 106 patients, including 53 in each group. Pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) after preoxygenation (99% (96%–100%) vs. 96% (90%–99%), p = .001) and minimum SpO2 during intubation (95% (87%–100%) vs. 83% (74%–91%), p < .01) were both significantly higher in the NIV compared with the control group. Severe hypoxemic events (SpO2 < 80%) occurred less frequently in the NIV group than in controls (7.4% vs. 37.7%, respectively; p < .01).

These regulatory elements—located in or near gene—bind to proteins called transcription factors to initiate the transcription process. Their occurrences are influenced by the GC-content or nucleotide composition. For generating synthetic coding sequences with pre-specified amino acid sequence and desired GC-content, there exist two stochastic methods, multinomial and maximum entropy. Both methods rely on the probability of choosing the codon synonymous for usage in regard to a specific amino acid. In spite the latter exhibited unbiased manner, the produced sequences are not exactly obeying the GC-content constraint. In this paper, we present an algorithmic solution to produce coding sequences that follow exactly a primary amino acid sequence and a desired GC-content. The proposed tool, namely CodSeqGen, depends on random selection for smaller subsets to be traversed using the backtracking approach.","3d026627a1f1f6af6f6fbb07bbcb84d917c7c946","True","Genomics","GC|GC|two|GC|GC|CodSeqGen","els-covid","","","30738198","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.ygeno.2019.02.002","custom_license"

In the last century, some researchers and clinician have noticed that the psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning of patients with malignant gliomas can be impaired. Many clinical studies have demonstrated that part of patients, adults or children, diagnosed with glioblastoma will suffer from cognitive deficiency during their clinical course, especially in long-term survivors. Many nanoparticles (NPs) can inhibit the biological functions of tumours by modulating tumour-associated inflammation, which provokes angiogenesis and tumour growth. As one of the best antiviral nanoparticles (AVNPs), AVNP2 is the 2nd generation of AVNP2 that have been conjugated to graphite-graphene for improving physiochemical performance and reducing toxicity. AVNP2 inactivates viruses, such as the H1N1 and H5N1influenza viruses and even the SARS coronavirus, while it inhibits bacteria, such as MRSA and E. coli. As antimicrobials, nanoparticles are considered to be one of the vectors for the administration of therapeutic compounds. Yet, little is known about their potential functionalities and toxicities to the neurotoxic effects of cancer. Herein, we explored the functionality of AVNP2 on inhibiting C6 in glioma-bearing rats. The novel object-recognition test and open-field test showed that AVNP2 significantly improved the neuro-behaviour affected by C6 glioma. AVNP2 also alleviated the decline of long-term potentiation (LTP) and the decreased density of dendritic spines in the CA1 region induced by C6. Western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining showed that the expressions of synaptic-related proteins (PSD-95 and SYP) were increased, and these findings were in accordance with the results mentioned above. It revealed that the sizes of tumours in C6 glioma-bearing rats were smaller after treatment with AVNP2. The decreased expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) by Western blotting assay and ELISA, angiogenesis protein (VEGF) by Western blotting assay and other related proteins (BDNF, NF-ĸB, iNOS and COX-2) by Western blotting assay in peri-tumour tissue indicated that AVNP2 could control tumour-associated inflammation, thus efficiently ameliorating the local inflammatory condition and, to some extent, inhibiting angiogenesis in C6-bearing rats. In conclusion, our results suggested that AVNP2 could have an effect on the peri-tumor environment, obviously restraining the growth progress of gliomas, and eventually improving cognitive levels in C6-bearing rats.","0dbe4d649872b1ecd33637cf4bcdeca805d2b714","True","Brain, Behavior, and Immunity","Glioblastoma|the last century|one|AVNP2|the 2nd generation|AVNP2|AVNP2|H1N1|MRSA|Herein|AVNP2|AVNP2|AVNP2|LTP|CA1|PSD-95|SYP|AVNP2|IL-6|TNF-α|ELISA|VEGF|Western|BDNF|COX-2|Western|AVNP2|AVNP2","els-covid","","","32097763","PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG|NORP|GPE|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-02-22","","10.1016/j.bbi.2020.02.009","custom_license"

Due to costly antibiotic treatment, and increasing resistance of pneumococcus, developing high-efficient protective vaccine against this pathogen is an urgent need. Although the pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) and pneumonia conjugate vaccines (PCV) are the efficient pneumococcal vaccine in children and adult groups, but the serotype replacement of S. pneumoniae strains causes the reduction in efficacy of such vaccines. For overcoming the aforesaid drawbacks epitope-based vaccines are introduced as the relevant alternative. In our previous research, the epitope vaccine was designed based on immunodominant epitopes from PspA, CbpA antigens as cellular stimulants and PhtD, PiuA as humoral stimulants. Because the low immunogenicity is the main disadvantage of epitope vaccine, in the current study, we applied coiled-coil self-assembled structures for developing our vaccine. Recently, self-assembled peptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) have gained much attention in the field of vaccine development due to their multivalency, self-adjuvanticity, biocompatibility, and size similarity to pathogen. In this regard, the final designed vaccine is comprised of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes from PspA and CbpA, helper T lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes from PhtD and PiuA, the pentamer and trimmer oligomeric domains form 5-stranded and 3-stranded coiled-coils as self-assembled scaffold, Diphtheria toxoids (DTD) as a universal T-helper, which fused to each other with appropriate linkers. The four different arrangements based on the order of above-mentioned compartments were constructed, and each of them were modeled, and validated to find the 3D structure. The structural, physicochemical, and immunoinformatics analyses of final vaccine construct represented that our vaccine could stimulate potent immune response against S. pneumoniae; however, the potency of that should be approved via various in vivo and in vitro immunological tests.","b86c590a17d44679d13f690c7eb082d56c195777","True","Molecular and Cellular Probes","PPV|PCV|S.|CTL|HTL|5-stranded|3-stranded|Diphtheria|DTD|four|S.","els-covid","","","31520715","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.mcp.2019.101446","custom_license"

This disease is one of the most important infectious diseases in cats, and it is associated with high mortality, particularly among younger cats. In this study, we isolated a wild-type FIPV HRB-17 epidemic strain from the blood sample of household pet cat exhibiting the characteristic wet-form FIP symptoms, which has been confirmed further by animal infection. Further, we developed an EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay for the accurate detection of FCoV based on the amplification of the highly conserved FIPV N gene. Then, using a combination of the real-time RT-PCR approach and a serum chemistry assay, we performed an epidemiological survey of FIPV infection in cats living in Harbin City, Northeast China. The results indicated that the EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay can be used for screening FCoV infection in the affected cats at an analytical detection limit of 8.2 × 101 viral genome copies/μL, but could not effectively distinguish FIPVs from FECVs. Additionally, the results of the epidemiological survey investigating feline blood samples (n = 1523) collected between July 2017 to July 2019 revealed an FIPV prevalence of approximately 12% (189/1523). Maybe, the prevalence would be less than 12% due to the real-time RT-PCR assay could not accurately differentiate FIPV and FECV. Nevertheless, it still highlighted the severity of the FIP epidemic in cats and reiterated the urgent need to develop effective anti-FIP therapeutic agents and anti-FIPV vaccines.

Although their antiviral mechanism(s) may vary depending on virus/host interaction, these oxysterols share the common feature to hamper viral replication by interacting with cellular proteins. Here reported is the first analysis of the modulation of a cell proteome by these two oxysterols, that, besides yielding additional clues about their potential involvement in the regulation of sterol metabolism, provides novelinsights about the mechanism underlying the inhibition of virus entry and trafficking within infected cells. We show here that both 25HC and 27HC can down-regulate the junction adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and the cation independent isoform of mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPRci), two crucial molecules for the replication of all those viruses that exploit adhesion molecules and the endosomal pathway to enter and diffuse within target cells.","d100406771e2d29572652ae1cbc7469a01c6f193","True","Free Radical Biology and Medicine","27-hydroxycholesterol|first|two|MPRci|two","els-covid","","","31525455","CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.08.031","custom_license"

The death of A549 cells induced by A + N morphologically resembles inflammation-inducing pyroptosis - cell destruction triggered by activated caspase-1. The treatment with A + N (or camptothecin) strongly upregulated caspase-1 and its two activators: IFI16 and NLRP1, however, caspase-1 activation was not detected. A549 cells may have been primed for pyroptosis, with the absence of a crucial trigger. The investigation of additional innate immunity elements revealed that A + N (or camptothecin) stimulated the expression of NLRX1, STING (stimulator of interferon genes) and two antiviral proteins, IFIT1 and IFIT3. IFI16 and caspase-1 are coded by p53-regulated genes which led us to investigate regulation of NLRP1, NLRX1, STING, IFIT1 and IFIT3 in p53-dependent mode. The upregulation of NLRP1, NLRX1 and STING was attenuated in p53 knockdown cells. The upsurge of the examined genes, and activation of p53, was inhibited by C16, an inhibitor of PKR kinase. PKR was tested due to its ability to phosphorylate p53 on Ser392. Surprisingly, C16 was active even in PKR knockdown cells. The ability of C16 to prevent activation of p53 and expression of innate immunity genes may be the source of its strong anti-inflammatory action. Moreover, cells exposed to A + N can influence neighboring cells in paracrine fashion, for instance, they shed ectodomain of COL17A1 protein and induce, in p53-dependent mode, the expression of gene for interleukin-7. Further, the activation of p53 also spurred the expression of SOCS1, an inhibitor of interferon triggered STAT1-dependent signaling. We conclude that, stimulation of p53 primes cells for the production of interferons (through upregulation of STING), and may activate negative-feedback within this signaling system by enhancing the production of SOCS1.","9fb07c0520781ebd106f2bb752c8a54b60362656","True","Cellular Signalling","Ser392|caspase-1|N|caspase-1|two|NLRP1|caspase-1|NLRX1, STING (|two|IFIT1|IFIT3|caspase-1|NLRP1|NLRX1|STING|IFIT1|IFIT3|NLRP1|NLRX1|STING|C16|PKR|PKR|Ser392|C16|PKR|C16|COL17A1|SOCS1|SOCS1","els-covid","","","32032660","GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|PRODUCT|LOC|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-05-31","","10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109552","custom_license"

Due to the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the best tool to find therapeutic solution. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin or ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococci infection, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of MERS-coronarivus viral cycle in human cells.

In recent years, China’s main focuses for enhancing disaster management have included emergency preparation, emergency management, and legal system mechanisms. However, its well-designed management system faced a great challenge during the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. By examining the literature on the development of disaster management, we realized that enhancing self-organization in communities can effectively resolve problems caused by collective actions and strengthen resilience to disasters. In the decade since the Wenchuan earthquake, the literature has focused more on empowering communities during disaster management in China. However, literature on the compatibility of social resilience and the government-dominant model in China is still scant. This study investigates China’s current disaster management system design; specifically, it identifies ways and methods for counteracting any conflicts between disaster management under social synergies and China’s emergency management system. It further explores what factors facilitate the balance between social synergies and the emergency management system if the two concepts were fused together. Using case studies, in-depth interviews, and a focus group in the field of public administration, this study collected qualitative data to understand the changes in China’s disaster management system since the Wenchuan earthquake as well as provide recommendations for future reform.","aaf6a06b9fd1d82d84c725afedf72f903eacbdee","True","Safety Science","November 2007|China|recent years|China|Wenchuan|2008|the decade|Wenchuan|China|China|China|China|two|China|Wenchuan","els-covid","","","","DATE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-06-30","","10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104662","custom_license"

Symptoms of this rare interstitial pulmonary disease can be either acute or sub-acute and it can rapidly progress to death. Diagnosis should be considered in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) if patients’ symptomatology and radiology correlates with non-responding or progressive pneumonia and when morphology, on biopsies, encompasses criteria of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and organizing pneumonia (OP) balancing in between. Three clinical cases of patients presenting severe lung disease requiring mechanical ventilation and prolonged intensive care fitted on the variable spectra of AFOP histopathology and had poor outcome: a 23 year-old women had AFOP in the context of antiphospholipid syndrome pulmonary compromise; a 35 year-old man developed a letal intensive care pneumonia with AFOP pattern registered in post-mortem biopsy; and a 79 year-old man died 21 days after intensive care unit treatment of a sub-pleural organizing pneumonia with intra-alveolar fibrin, seen in post-mortem biopsy. The predominance of acute fibrin alveolar deposition pattern is helpful in raising AFOP differential diagnosis while organizing pneumonia pattern establishes a wider range of diagnosis that can go till solitary pulmonary nodule, remaining indefinite to suggest diagnosis. The performance time of biopsy in a larger number of clinical cases may be helpful in establishing the evolutionary morphological pattern, taking in mind the poor outcome of the disease, deserving rapid diagnosis to define treatment.","5d57be6861370c09c063237a35b5688072631ca2","True","Pathophysiology","Organizing Pneumonitis|AFOP|Diagnosis|the Intensive Care Unit|patients’|Three|AFOP|23 year-old|AFOP|35 year-old|AFOP|79 year-old|21 days|AFOP","els-covid","","","","PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.pathophys.2019.04.001","custom_license"

The morphology of the microfiber mat was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The thermal and mechanical properties, water contact angle, surface area and pore size of the microfiber mats were characterized. Due to the introduction of graphene which can interact with silk fibroin, the SF/PLGA/GO microfiber mat, compared with the silk fibroin/poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (SF/PLGA) microfiber mat, has higher strength, greater Young's modulus and better thermal stability which can meet the requirements of protective fabric. The microfiber mat is biodegradable because its main component is silk fibroin and PLGA. In particular, the microfiber mat has a small pore size range of 4 ∼ 10 nm in diameter, a larger surface area of 2.63 m2 g-1 and pore volume of 7.09 × 10-3 cm3 g-1. The small pore size of the mat can effectively block the particulate pollutants and pathogenic particles in the air. The larger surface area and pore volume of the mat are effective for breathability.

We aimed to identify the association between multiple respiratory viral infections and PICU admission among infants with bronchiolitis. Methods We performed a 1:1 case-control study enrolling previously healthy full-term infants (≤12 months) with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU as cases and those to the general pediatric ward as controls from 2015 to 2017. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of the respiratory viruses. We summarized the characteristics of infants admitted to the PICU and the general pediatric unit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to fit the association between multiple respiratory viral infections (≥2 strains) and PICU admission. Results A total of 135 infants admitted to the PICU were compared with 135 randomly selected control infants admitted to the general pediatric unit. The PICU patients were younger (median: 2.2 months, interquartile range: 1.3–4.2) than the general ward patients (median: 3.2 months, interquartile range: 1.6–6.4). Respiratory syncytial virus (74.1%), rhinovirus (28.9%), and coronavirus (5.9%) were the most common viruses for bronchiolitis requiring PICU admission. Patients with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU tended to have multiple viral infections compared with patients on the general ward (23.0% vs. 10.4%, P <0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, bronchiolitis with multiple viral infections was associated with higher odds of PICU admission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.17–5.57, P =0.02). Conclusion Infants with multiviral bronchiolitis have higher odds of PICU admission compared with those with a single or nondetectable viral infection.","bc06fb25ec1474926f52a9d307ba032f68317cda","True","Archives de Pédiatrie","PICU|PICU|1:1|months|PICU|2015|Multiplex|PICU|PICU|135|PICU|135|PICU|2.2 months|1.3–4.2|3.2 months|1.6–6.4|74.1%|28.9%|5.9%|PICU|PICU|23.0%|10.4%|0.001|PICU|2.56|95%|1.17–5.57|0.02|PICU","els-covid","","","31780096","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|DATE|NORP|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.arcped.2019.11.006","custom_license"

"Bashir, Shariq","An efficient pattern growth approach for mining fault tolerant frequent itemsets","Abstract Mining fault tolerant (FT) frequent itemsets from transactional databases are computationally more expensive than mining exact matching frequent itemsets. Previous algorithms mine FT frequent itemsets using Apriori heuristic. Apriori-like algorithms generate exponential number of candidate itemsets including the itemsets that do not exist in the database. These algorithms require multiple scans of database for counting the support of candidate FT itemsets. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, which mines FT frequent itemsets using frequent pattern growth approach (FT-PatternGrowth). FT-PatternGrowth adopts a divide-and-conquer technique and recursively projects transactional database into a set of smaller projected transactional databases and mines FT frequent itemsets in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent items. This mines the complete set of FT frequent itemsets and substantially reduces those candidate itemsets that do not exist in the database. FT-PatternGrowth stores the transactional database in a highly condensed much smaller data structure called frequent pattern tree (FP-tree). The support of candidate itemsets are counted directly from the FP-tree without scanning the original database multiple times. This improves the processing speed of algorithm. Our experiments on benchmark databases indicates mining FT frequent itemsets using FT-PatternGrowth is highly efficient than Apriori-like algorithms.","279b0d759797da6f427f04800f956804cef11194","True","Expert Systems with Applications","Apriori|PatternGrowth|FP|FP|Apriori","els-covid","","","","GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE","Elsevier","2020-04-01","","10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113046","custom_license"

"Huang, Jiechen; Wang, Juan; Xia, Chengyi","Role of vaccine efficacy in the vaccination behavior under myopic update rule on complex networks","Abstract How to effectively prevent the diffusion of infectious disease has become an intriguing topic in the field of public hygienics. To be noted that, for the non-periodic infectious diseases, many people hope to obtain the vaccine of epidemics in time to be inoculated, rather than at the end of the epidemic. However, the vaccine may fail as a result of invalid storage, transportation and usage, and then vaccinated individuals may become re-susceptible and be infected again during the outbreak. To this end, we build a new framework that considers the imperfect vaccination during the one cycle of infectious disease within the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. Meanwhile, we propose a new vaccination update rule: myopic update rule, which is only based on one focal player’s own perception regarding the disease outbreak, and one susceptible individual makes a decision to adopt the vaccine just by comparing the perceived payoffs vaccination with the perceived ones of being infected. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the imperfect vaccination behavior under the myopic update rule in the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. The results indicate that healthy individuals are often willing to inoculate the vaccine under the myopic update rule, which can stop the infectious disease from being spread, in particular, it is found that the vaccine efficacy influences the fraction of vaccinated individuals much more than the relative cost of vaccination on the regular lattice, Meanwhile, vaccine efficacy is more sensitive on the heterogeneous scale-free network. Current results are helpful to further analyze and model the choice of vaccination strategy during the disease outbreaks.","bd4fc9d981f442dbc210a67500cabf238e259801","True","Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","one|Extensive Monte-Carlo","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.chaos.2019.109425","custom_license"

Sharpless–Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation and Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation were employed to construct the octahydroisochromene scaffold.

Our initial evaluations of the diastereo-isomeric mixtures (16a–d) revealed that the octahydroisochromene moiety functions as a core hydrophobic scaffold for the S2 pocket of the protease and the substituent at the 1-position may form additional interactions with the protease. The inhibitory activities of the diastereoisomerically-pure inhibitors (3a–d) strongly suggest that a specific stereo-isomer of the octahydroisochromene scaffold, (1S, 3S) 3b, directs the P1 site imidazole, the warhead aldehyde, and substituent at the 1-position of the fused ring to their appropriate pockets in the protease.","dfdbbed7b06c9e9c988682c4371629b522c33a15","True","Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry","3CL|1-position|Sharpless|His-al|3a–d|3S|3b|1-position","els-covid","","","31926775","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|QUANTITY|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-02-15","","10.1016/j.bmc.2019.115273","custom_license"

In this study, we for the first time proposed a nanosystem for CPV-2 DNA detection with RNA-guided RNA endonuclease Cas13a, which upon activation results in collateral RNA degradation. We expressed LwCas13a in prokaryotic expression system and purified it through nickel column. Activity of Cas13a was verified by RNA-bound fluorescent group while using a quenched fluorescent probe as signals. Further Cas13a was combined with Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and T7 transcription to establish molecular detection system termed specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter un-locking (SHERLOCK) for sensitive detection of CPV-2 DNA. This nanosystem can detect 100 amol/L CPV-2 DNA within 30 min. The proposed nanosystem exhibited high specificity when tested for CPV-2 and other dog viruses.

"Sasaki, Karin; Bruder, Dunja; Hernandez-Vargas, Esteban A.","Topological data analysis to model the shape of immune responses during co-infections","Abstract Co-infections by multiple pathogens have important implications in many aspects of health, epidemiology and evolution. However, how to disentangle the non-linear dynamics of the immune response when two infections take place at the same time is largely unexplored. Using data sets of the immune response during influenza-pneumococcal co-infection in mice, we employ here topological data analysis to simplify and visualise high dimensional data sets. We identified persistent shapes of the simplicial complexes of the data in the three infection scenarios: single viral infection, single bacterial infection, and co-infection. The immune response was found to be distinct for each of the infection scenarios and we uncovered that the immune response during the co-infection has three phases and two transition points. During the first phase, its dynamics is inherited from its response to the primary (viral) infection. The immune response has an early shift (few hours post co-infection) and then modulates its response to react against the secondary (bacterial) infection. Between 18 and 26 h post co-infection the nature of the immune response changes again and does no longer resembles either of the single infection scenarios.","5d05c05e4c39296c7c4282c82f9f33929418bf86","True","Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation","two|three|three|two|first|(few hours|Between 18 and 26 h","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|TIME|DATE","Elsevier","2020-06-30","","10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105228","custom_license"

Cytokines have become valuable diagnostic tools in many medical fields. The role of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytokines is of unknown value to diagnose ACR and distinguish rejection from infection. We hypothesized that distinct cytokine patterns obtained by surveillance bronchoscopies during the first year after transplantation are associated with ACR and microbiologic findings. We retrospectively analyzed data from 319 patients undergoing lung transplantation at University Hospital Zurich from 1998 to 2016. We compared levels of IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ and TNF-α in 747 BAL samples with transbronchial biopsies (TBB) and microbiologic results from surveillance bronchoscopies. We aimed to define reference values that would allow distinction between four specific groups “ACR”, “infection”, “combined ACR and infection” and “no pathologic process”. No definitive pattern was identified. Given the overlap between groups, these four cytokines are not suitable diagnostic markers for ACR or infection after lung transplantation.","8420278819a8d048c868efb31f9aedb0cd4caf9b","True","Cytokine","ACR|BAL|ACR|the first year|ACR|319|University Hospital Zurich|1998 to 2016|IL-6|IL-8|IFN-γ|TNF-α|747|BAL|TBB|four|ACR|four|ACR","els-covid","","","31400641","ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.cyto.2019.154794","custom_license"

Our study reports the successful production of IFNλ4 from a mammalian cell line through a glycoengineering and structure-based approach. We introduced de novo N-glycosylation of IFNλ4, guided by structural analysis, and produced IFNλ4 variants in Expi293F that displayed improved expression and potency. To preserve the structure and functionality of IFNλ4, the model structure of the IFNλ4 signaling complex was analyzed and the N-glycosylation candidate sites were selected. The receptor binding activity of engineered IFNλ4 variants and their receptor-mediated signaling pathway were similar to the E. coli version of IFNλ4 (eIFNλ4), while the antiviral activity and induction levels of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) were all more robust in our variants.

Inflammatory responses have a significant impact on MERS-CoV pathogenesis and disease outcome. However, CD4+ T-cell induced immune responses during acute MERS-CoV infection are barely detectable, with potent inhibition of effector T cells and downregulation of antigen presentation. The local pulmonary immune response, particularly the Th1 and Th2-related immune response during acute severe MERS-CoV infection is not fully understood. In this study, we offer the first insights into the pulmonary gene expression profile of Th1 and Th2-related cytokines/chemokines (Th1 & Th2 responses) during acute MERS-CoV infection using RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays. We also quantified the expression level of primary inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Our results showed a downregulation of Th2, inadequate (partial) Th1 immune response and high expression levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β and the neutrophil chemoattractant chemokine IL-8 (CXCL8) in the lower respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected patients. Moreover, we identified a high viral load in all included patients. We also observed a correlation between inflammatory cytokines, Th1, and Th2 downregulation and the case fatality rate. Th1 and Th2 response downregulation, high expression of inflammatory cytokines, and high viral load may contribute to lung inflammation, severe infection, the evolution of pneumonia and ARDS, and a higher case fatality rate. Further study of the molecular mechanisms underlying the Th1 and Th2 regulatory pathways will be vital for active vaccine development and the identification of novel therapeutic strategies.","319663b2ac3cd9beb28724b6a3f4e2e6b0c2c59a","True","Cytokine","CoV|CoV|CoV|Th2-related|CoV|first|Th2-related|Th1 &|CoV|RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays|neutrophil|CXCL8|CoV|ARDS","els-covid","","","31706200","PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.cyto.2019.154895","custom_license"
"Barjesteh, Neda; O'Dowd, Kelsey; Vahedi, Seyed Milad","Antiviral responses against chicken respiratory infections: Focus on avian influenza virus and infectious bronchitis virus","Abstract Some of the respiratory viral infections in chickens pose a significant threat to the poultry industry and public health. In response to viral infections, host innate responses provide the first line of defense against viruses, which often act even before the establishment of the infection. Host cells sense the presence of viral components through germinal encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The engagement of PRRs with pathogen-associated molecular patterns leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory and interferon productions. Induced antiviral responses play a critical role in the outcome of the infections. In order to improve current strategies for control of viral infections or to advance new strategies aimed against viral infections, a deep understanding of host-virus interaction and induction of antiviral responses is required. In this review, we summarized recent progress in understanding innate antiviral responses in chickens with a focus on the avian influenza virus and infectious bronchitis virus.","55b475087049aab4db5dba6bcff6423d3f7340a2","True","Cytokine","first","els-covid","","","31901597","ORDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.cyto.2019.154961","custom_license"

Compared to other developing countries like India, it has special positive features of career incentives promoting growth at the local level, the ability to take long-term decisions relatively quickly, and a unique blend of political centralization and decentralization of economic power and responsibility, that is conducive to central guidance and local business development. On the other hand, with a lack of sufficient downward (as opposed to upward) accountability and absence of institutionalized systems of scrutiny and challenge from below, mistakes or abuse of power are more difficult to check and correct quickly, political loyalty may often get a premium over performance at the upper levels, and there are insufficient checks on collusion between business and officials. The over-all organizational system is prone to over-reaction in times of crisis and thus only weakly resilient compared to systems where information flows from below are less controlled or choked.","f887e689c31124e95194e9cb37c256fd19710405","True","China Economic Review","Chinese|India","els-covid","","","","NORP|GPE","Elsevier","2020-06-30","","10.1016/j.chieco.2020.101430","custom_license"

Some alterations of glycosylation, such as sialic acid hydrolysis, are related to protein dysfunction. Because of their high flexibility and the many reactive groups of the glycan chains, studying glycans with in vitro methods is a challenging task. Molecular dynamics is a useful tool and probably the only one in biology able to overcome this problem and gives access to conformational information through exhaustive sampling. To better decipher the impact of N-glycans, the analysis and visualization of their influence over time on protein structure is a prerequisite. We developed the Umbrella Visualization, a graphical method that assigns the glycan intrinsic flexibility during a molecular dynamics trajectory. The density plot generated by this method brought relevant informations regarding glycans dynamics and flexibility, but needs further development in order to integrate an accurate description of the protein topology and its interactions. We propose here to transform this analysis method into a visualization mode in UnityMol. UnityMol is a molecular editor, viewer and prototyping platform, coded in C#. The new representation of glycan chains presented in this study takes into account both the main positions adopted by each antenna of a glycan and their statistical relevance. By displaying the collected data on the protein surface, one is then able to investigate the protein/glycan interactions.","94c536f91e8c227a5411a614320919f9e39b4dcb","True","Methods","the Umbrella Visualization|UnityMol|UnityMol","els-covid","","","31302178","ORG|GPE|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-15","","10.1016/j.ymeth.2019.07.010","custom_license"

The residue or combination of residues acting as pH sensors has not yet been fully elucidated. In this work, we assay pH effects on the structure of H5 HA by soaking HA crystallized at pH 6.5 in a series of buffers with lower pH, mimicking the conditions of the endosome. We find that HA1-H38, which is conserved in Group 1 HA, undergoes a striking change in side chain conformation, which we attribute to its protonation and cation-cation repulsion with conserved HA1-H18. This work suggests that x-ray crystallography can be applied for studying small-scale pH-induced conformational changes providing valuable information on the location of pH sensors in HA. Importantly, the observed change in HA1-H38 conformation is further evidence that the pH-induced conformational changes of HA are the result of a series of protonation events to conserved and non-conserved pH sensors.","19d492500dc37b80aa00792ee67dd7093ade4301","True","Journal of Structural Biology","H5|HA|HA1-H38|Group 1 HA|HA1-H18|HA|HA1-H38","els-covid","","","31689502","DATE|GPE|GPE|FAC|PERSON|GPE|GPE","Elsevier","2020-01-01","","10.1016/j.jsb.2019.107412","custom_license"

LTLs are homologous to leguminous lectins. In this study, we identified and functionally characterized an LTL from kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus. We designated this LTL as MjLTL2. MjLTL2 contains a signal peptide, a Lectin_leg domain, a coiled coil, and transmembrane domain. MjLTL2 is distributed in hemocytes, heart, hepatopancreas, gill, stomach, and intestine; higher expression levels are seen in hemocytes and the hepatopancreas than in other tissues. MjLTL2 was upregulated following challenge of shrimp with Vibrio anguillarum and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). MjLTL2 can agglutinate several bacteria without Ca2+. In addition, MjLTL2 could bind to several Gram-positive and -negative bacteria by binding to their lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. However, MjLTL2 could not enhance the clearance of V. anguillarum in vivo. In the presence of WSSV infection, MjLTL2 knockdown by RNA interference resulted in a 7-day lower cumulative mortality of M. japonicus. Moreover, less VP19, VP24, VP26, and VP28 mRNAs were extracted from the hemocytes of MjLTL2 knockdown shrimp than from the control.

First, overexpression of VP56 inhibited the IFN production induced by the polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), while the capacity of IRF7 on IFN induction was unaffected. Second, VP56 interacted with RLRs but did not affect the stabilization of the proteins in the normal state, while the phosphorylated IRF7 activated by TBK1 was degraded by VP56 through K48-linked ubiquitination. Finally, overexpression of VP56 remarkably reduced the host cellular ifn transcription and facilitated viral proliferation.

It selectivity binds to Glc2-N-glycan and is involved in a glycoprotein quality control mechanism. Even though malectin may play a role in immunity, its role in innate immunity is not fully known. In the present study, we identified and characterized the malectin gene from Hippocampus abdominalis (HaMLEC). We analyzed sequence features, spatial expression levels, temporal expression profiles upon immune responses, bacterial and carbohydrate binding abilities and anti-viral properties to investigate the potential role of HaMLEC in innate immunity. The molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) were estimated to be 31.99 kDa and 5.17, respectively. The N-terminal signal peptide, malectin superfamily domain and C-terminal transmembrane region were identified from the amino acid sequence of HaMLEC. The close evolutionary relationship of HaMLEC with other teleosts was identified by phylogenetic analysis. According to quantitative PCR (qPCR) results, HaMLEC expression was observed in all the examined tissues and high expression was observed in the ovary and brain, compared to other tested tissues. Temporal expression of HaMLEC in liver and blood tissues were significant modulated upon exposure to immunogens Edwardasiella tarda, Streptococcus iniae, polyinosinic:polycytidylic and lipopolysaccharide. The presence of carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) of bacterial glycosyl hydrolases were functionally confirmed by a bacterial binding assay.

In this study, we determined whether symptomatic respiratory viral infections after lung transplantation induce circulating exosomes that contain lung-associated self-antigens and assessed whether these exosomes activate immune responses to self-antigens. METHODS Serum samples were collected from lung transplant recipients with symptomatic lower- and upper-tract respiratory viral infections and from non-symptomatic stable recipients. Exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation; purity was determined using sucrose cushion; and presence of lung self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens for rhinovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were determined using immunoblot. Mice were immunized with circulating exosomes from each group and resulting differential immune responses and lung histology were analyzed. RESULTS Exosomes containing self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens were detected at significantly higher levels (p < 0.05) in serum of recipients with symptomatic respiratory viral infections (n = 35) as compared with stable controls (n = 32). Mice immunized with exosomes from recipients with respiratory viral infections developed immune responses to self-antigens, fibrosis, small airway occlusion, and significant cellular infiltration; mice immunized with exosomes from controls did not (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Circulating exosomes isolated from lung transplant recipients diagnosed with respiratory viral infections contained lung self-antigens, viral antigens, and 20S proteasome and elicited immune responses to lung self-antigens that resulted in development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction in immunized mice.","48cfc52918bb6109021753c43ea1ae2f75ebaa76","True","The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation","0.05|35|32|0.05","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-01-21","","10.1016/j.healun.2019.12.009","custom_license"

Broadly neutralizing mAb rEBOV-520 targeted a conserved epitope on the GP base region. mAb rEBOV-548 bound to a glycan cap epitope, possessed neutralizing and Fc-mediated effector function activities, and potentiated neutralization by rEBOV-520. Remodeling of the glycan cap structures by the cocktail enabled enhanced GP binding and virus neutralization. The cocktail demonstrated resistance to virus escape and protected non-human primates (NHPs) against Ebola virus disease. These data illuminate structural principles of antibody cooperativity with implications for development of antiviral immunotherapeutics.","83a2a3376e606acac755f739853a8352de7f4597","True","Immunity","mAbs|two|mAb|GP|mAb|Fc","els-covid","","","32023489","ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-18","","10.1016/j.immuni.2020.01.001","custom_license"
"Barcik, Weronika; Boutin, Rozlyn C.T.; Sokolowska, Milena; Finlay, B. Brett","The Role of Lung and Gut Microbiota in the Pathology of Asthma","Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Clinical features of asthma and its immunological and molecular etiology vary significantly among patients. An understanding of the complexities of asthma has evolved to the point where precision medicine approaches, including microbiome analysis, are being increasingly recognized as an important part of disease management. Lung and gut microbiota play several important roles in the development, regulation, and maintenance of healthy immune responses. Dysbiosis and subsequent dysregulation of microbiota-related immunological processes affect the onset of the disease, its clinical characteristics, and responses to treatment. Bacteria and viruses are the most extensively studied microorganisms relating to asthma pathogenesis, but other microbes, including fungi and even archaea, can potently influence airway inflammation. This review focuses on recently discovered connections between lung and gut microbiota, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea, and their influence on asthma.","e0b7ce4800153abd90f0ed89a87efd07767db0e8","True","Immunity","Asthma|more than 300 million|Clinical|Bacteria","els-covid","","","32075727","ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE","Elsevier","2020-02-18","","10.1016/j.immuni.2020.01.007","custom_license"

In this study, we describe and update the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of IPS. We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adults who underwent allogeneic HCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between 2006 and 2013 (n = 1829). IPS was defined using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute consensus definition: multilobar airspace opacities on chest imaging, absence of lower respiratory tract infection, and hypoxemia. We described IPS incidence and mortality within 120 and 365 days after HCT. We examined conditioning intensity (nonmyeloablative versus myeloablative with high-dose total body irradiation [TBI] versus myeloablative with low-dose TBI) as an IPS risk factor in a time-to-event analysis using Cox models, controlled for age at transplant, HLA matching, stem cell source, and pretransplant Lung function Score (a combined measure of impairment in Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) and Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)). Among 1829 HCT recipients, 67 fulfilled IPS criteria within 120 days (3.7%). Individuals who developed IPS were more likely to be black/non-Hispanic versus other racial groups and have severe pulmonary impairment but were otherwise similar to participants without IPS. In adjusted models, myeloablative conditioning with high-dose TBI was associated with increased risk of IPS (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 5.2). Thirty-one patients (46.3%) with IPS died within the first 120 days of HCT and 47 patients (70.1%) died within 365 days of HCT. In contrast, among the 1762 patients who did not acquire IPS in the first 120 days, 204 (11.6%) died within 120 days of HCT and 510 (29.9%) died within 365 days of HCT. Our findings suggest that although the incidence of IPS may be declining, it remains associated with post-transplant mortality. Future study should focus on early detection and identifying pathologic mediators of IPS to facilitate timely, targeted therapies for those most susceptible to lung injury post-HCT.","109cceb7306b8e73e47f9778cf154a5d1833e6e6","True","Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation","IPS|HCT|IPS|HCT|the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center|between 2006 and 2013|the National Heart|Lung|Blood Institute|IPS|120 and 365 days|HCT|IPS|Cox|HLA|Lung|Forced Expiratory Volume|first|second|Diffusion|DLCO|1829|HCT|67|IPS|120 days|3.7%|IPS|Hispanic|IPS|IPS|2.5|95%|1.2|5.2|Thirty-one|46.3%|IPS|the first 120 days|HCT|47|70.1%|365 days|HCT|1762|IPS|the first 120 days|204|11.6%|120 days|HCT|510|29.9%|365 days|HCT|IPS|IPS","els-covid","","","31605819","ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|PRODUCT|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|NORP|ORG|LAW|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|GPE|FAC","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.bbmt.2019.09.034","custom_license"

Bacterial infection stimulates autophagy, which is a part of innate immunity used to eliminate intracellular pathogens. Several intracellular bacteria have evolved multipronged strategies to circumvent this conserved system and thereby enhance their chance of intracellular survival. Nonetheless, studies on H. pylori have produced inconsistent results, showing either elevated or reduced clearance efficiency of intracellular bacteria through autophagy. In this review, we summarize recent studies on the mechanisms involved in autophagy induced by H. pylori and the fate of intracellular bacteria.","1b80c0f06f566e0741e678da7847b7443ead9317","True","Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology","Helicobacter|H.","els-covid","","","","PERSON|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-02-04","","10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.01.007","custom_license"

Pathogenic bacteria (Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh), Pasteurella multocida (Pm), Histophilus somni (Hs), and Mycoplasma bovis) and a range of viruses (bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, bovine viral diarrhea virus and bovine herpesvirus type 1) are associated with this complex. As most of these pathogens can be present in healthy and diseased calves, simple detection of their presence in diseased calves carries low predictive value. In other multi-agent diseases of livestock, quantification of pathogens has added substantially to the predictive value of microbiological diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of two recently developed quantitative PCR (qPCR) kits (Pneumo4B and Pneumo4V) to detect and quantify these bacterial and viral pathogens, respectively. Test efficiencies of the qPCR assays, based on nucleic acid dilution series of target bacteria and viruses, were 93–106% and 91–104%, respectively, with assay detection limits of 10–50 copies of nucleic acids. All 44 strains of target bacteria were correctly identified, with no false positive reactions in 135strains of non-target bacterial species. Based on standard curves of log10 CFU versus cycle threshold (Ct) values, quantification was possible over a 5-log range of bacteria. In 92 tracheal aspirate samples, the kappa values for agreement between Pneumo4B and bacterial culture were 0.64-0.84 for Mh, Pm and Hs. In an additional 84 tracheal aspirates, agreement between Pneumo4B or Pneumo 4V and certified diagnostic qPCR assays was moderate (0.57) for M. bovis and high (0.71–0.90) for viral pathogens. Thus Pneumo4 kits specifically detected and quantified the relevant pathogens.","1838c8db88e90d728f332671f33c7c51c233ee24","True","The Veterinary Journal","Pathogenic|Mannheimia|Pasteurella|Histophilus|Mycoplasma|two|Pneumo4V|93–106%|91–104%|10–50|44|CFU|Ct|92|between Pneumo4B|0.64|an additional 84|Pneumo|Pneumo4","els-covid","","","32113583","PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.tvjl.2020.105425","custom_license"
"Alizadeh, Ali Akbar; Jafari, Behzad; Dastmalchi, Siavoush","Alignment independent 3D-QSAR studies and molecular dynamics simulations for the identification of potent and selective S1P1 receptor agonists","Abstract Sphingosine 1-phosphate type 1 (S1P1) receptors are expressed on lymphocytes and regulate immune cells trafficking. Sphingosine 1-phosphate and its analogues cause internalization and degradation of S1P1 receptors, preventing the auto reactivity of immune cells in the target tissues. It has been shown that S1P1 receptor agonists such as fingolimod can be suitable candidates for treatment of autoimmune diseases. The current study aimed to generate GRIND-based 3D-QSAR predictive models for agonistic activities of 2-imino-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives on S1P1 to be used in virtual screening of chemical libraries. The developed model for the S1P1 receptor agonists showed appropriate power of predictivity in internal (r2 acc 0.93 and SDEC 0.18) and external (r2 0.75 and MAE (95% data), 0.28) validations. The generated model revealed the importance of variables DRY-N1 and DRY-O in the potency and selectivity of these compounds towards S1P1 receptor. To propose potential chemical entities with S1P1 agonistic activity, PubChem chemicals database was searched and the selected compounds were virtually tested for S1P1 receptor agonistic activity using the generated models, which resulted in four potential compounds with high potency and selectivity towards S1P1 receptor. Moreover, the affinities of the identified compounds towards S1P1 receptor were evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicated that the binding energies of the compounds were in the range of −39.31 to −46.18 and −3.20 to −9.75 kcal mol−1, calculated by MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA algorithms, respectively. The findings in the current work may be useful for the identification of potent and selective S1P1 receptor agonists with potential use in diseases such as multiple sclerosis.","711642ba1c1f4dc3cedb11f67f77d2c0425c9da3","True","Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling","1-phosphate|1-phosphate|GRIND|2-imino|r2|0.93|SDEC|0.18|r2 0.75|MAE|95%|0.28|DRY-O|PubChem|four|−39.31|MM-GBSA|MM","els-covid","","","31589999","CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.jmgm.2019.107459","custom_license"

A total of 125 BAL samples from immunosuppressed patients submitted for PJP-IFA were tested. Surplus samples were saved and further tested by using the PJ-CMV PCR assay. Among the 125 samples, P. jirovecii was detected in 31.2% (39/125) and in 40% (50/125) of the specimens using IFA and PJ-CMV PCR respectively. Eleven of the PJ-CMV PCR positive samples were negative by direct IFA for P. jirovecii. All samples positive by direct IFA were also positive by PJ-CMV PCR. Using the direct IFA as a gold standard, the PJ-CMV PCR sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for detection of P. jirovecii were 100%, 87.2%, 78% and 100%, respectively. However, after reviewing the clinical diagnosis, the specificity and PPV increased to 100%. Of the 50 P. jirovecii samples positive by PJ-CMV PCR, 18 (36%) were also positive for CMV by the PJ-CMV PCR. The co-infection rate was found to be 37.5% (6/16) and 35.2% (12/34) in HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients. This study indicated that the DiaSorin Molecular PJ-CMV multiplex real-time PCR assay has higher sensitivity than direct IFA for detection of P. jirovecii and provides rapid detection of PJ and CMV infection in BAL samples.","a004209667fdbd91ce2b281fc9af93f5b0d967e3","True","Journal de Mycologie Médicale","CMV|DiaSorin Molecular LLC|USA|BAL|IFA|Pneumocystis|CMV|P.|125|BAL|PJ|CMV|125|P.|31.2%|39/125|40%|50/125|IFA|PJ-CMV|Eleven|PJ-CMV|IFA|P.|IFA|PJ-CMV|IFA|PJ|CMV|P.|100%|87.2%|78%|100%|PPV|100%|50|PJ-CMV PCR|18|36%|CMV|PJ|CMV|37.5%|6/16|35.2%|12/34|CMV|IFA|P.|PJ|CMV|BAL","els-covid","","","","ORG|PRODUCT|GPE|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.mycmed.2020.100936","custom_license"

"Ak, Ç.; Ergönül, Ö.; Gönen, M.","A prospective prediction tool for understanding Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever dynamics in Turkey","Abstract Objectives We aimed to develop a prospective prediction tool on Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) to identify geographic regions at risk. The tool could support public health decision-makers in implementation of an effective control strategy in a timely manner. Methods We used monthly surveillance data between 2004 and 2015 to predict case counts between 2016 and 2017 prospectively. The Turkish nationwide surveillance data set collected by the Ministry of Health contained 10 411 confirmed CCHF cases. We collected potential explanatory covariates about climate, land use, and animal and human populations at risk to capture spatiotemporal transmission dynamics. We developed a structured Gaussian process algorithm and prospectively tested this tool predicting the future year's cases given past years' cases. Results We predicted the annual cases in 2016 and 2017 as 438 and 341, whereas the observed cases were 432 and 343, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient and normalized root mean squared error values for 2016 and 2017 predictions were (0.83; 0.58) and (0.87; 0.52), respectively. The most important covariates were found to be the number of settlements with fewer than 25 000 inhabitants, latitude, longitude and potential evapotranspiration (evaporation and transpiration). Conclusions Main driving factors of CCHF dynamics were human population at risk in rural areas, geographical dependency and climate effect on ticks. Our model was able to prospectively predict the numbers of CCHF cases. Our proof-of-concept study also provided insight for understanding possible mechanisms of infectious diseases and found important directions for practice and policy to combat against emerging infectious diseases.","5cb8afcb4fe6d5261f741ea877818fe3c2b69b84","True","Clinical Microbiology and Infection","Crimean–Congo|monthly|between 2004 and 2015|between 2016 and 2017|Turkish|the Ministry of Health|411|Gaussian|the future year's|years|annual|2016|2017|438|341|432|343|Pearson|2016|2017|0.83|0.58|0.87|0.52|fewer than 25","els-covid","","","31129282","GPE|DATE|DATE|DATE|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.cmi.2019.05.006","custom_license"

Turkey hosts the highest number of Syrian refugees in the world. By February 2019 over 3.6 million people had fled to Turkey to seek safety. Only 6.1% of Syrian refugees live in temporary shelters. Owing to the disrupted healthcare services, many children coming from the conflict zones are less likely to have received vaccination. In temporary shelters immunization coverage is >95% and the refugee population is receptive to vaccination. Aims The objective of this study was to review the infectious diseases situation among Syrian refugees in Turkey. Sources We have reviewed the reports and studies provided by the governmental and non-governmental organizations and obtained more detailed data from the Ministry of Health in Turkey. Content Between 2012 and 2016, 1 299 209 cases of respiratory tract infection and 158 058 episodes of diarrhoea with 59 bloody diarrhoeas were reported; 1354 hepatitis A cases and 108 active tuberculosis cases were detected and treated in the temporary shelters for Syrian refugees. Overall in Turkey, 7794 cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported. Implications Since the influx of Syrian refugees, there has been an increase in cases of leishmaniasis and measles. No significant increase was detected for tuberculosis, other vector-borne infections, and healthcare associated or sexually transmitted infections. The Syrian refugees can be considered as a vulnerable group in Turkey due to their living and working conditions.

This work was conducted to understand the epidemiological and phylogenetic features of RSV in southern China during 2011–2016. Methods A total of 16 024 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with respiratory infections in 14 hospitals, and screened for RSV and seven other respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Six hundred and twenty-three RSV-positive samples from 13 hospitals were further analyzed for subtypes. G gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed based on 46 RSV-A and 15 RSV-B strains. Results RSV was detected in 9.5% of the 16 024 specimens, the highest among the eight respiratory viruses screened. Most of these specimens came from inpatients and children under 3 years of age. The incidence of RSV-A (9.4%) was higher than that of RSV-B (4.4%) in children (<15 years), but not in adults (0.64% vs. 0.58%). A 2-year RSV-A dominance followed by a 1-year RSV-B dominance pattern was found. The co-detection rate of RSV was 25.1%. The main prevalent genotypes were NA1, ON1, and BA9.

"Wilburn, Jennifer; O’Connor, Catherine; Walsh, Amanda L.; Morgan, Dilys","Identifying potential emerging threats through epidemic intelligence activities—looking for the needle in the haystack?","Abstract Background Epidemic intelligence (EI) for emerging infections is the process of identifying key information on emerging infectious diseases and specific incidents. Automated web-based infectious disease surveillance technologies are available; however, human input is still needed to review, validate, and interpret these sources. In this study, entries captured by Public Health England’s (PHE) manual event-based EI system were examined to inform future intelligence gathering activities. Methods A descriptive analysis of unique events captured in a database between 2013 and 2017 was conducted. The top five diseases in terms of the number of entries were described in depth to determine the effectiveness of PHE’s EI surveillance system compared to other sources. Results Between 2013 and 2017, a total of 22 847 unique entries were added to the database. The top three initial and definitive information sources varied considerably by disease. Ebola entries dominated the database, making up 23.7% of the total, followed by Zika (11.8%), Middle East respiratory syndrome (6.7%), cholera (5.5%), and yellow fever and undiagnosed morbidity (both 3.3%). Initial reports of major outbreaks due to the top five disease agents were picked up through the manual system prior to being publicly reported by official sources. Conclusions PHE’s manual EI process quickly and accurately detected global public health threats at the earliest stages and allowed for monitoring of events as they evolved.","e462bb228009b4abfd91c6812450905609e62c49","True","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","EI|Public Health England’s|PHE|EI|between 2013 and 2017|five|PHE|EI|Between 2013 and 2017|22 847|three|23.7%|Zika|11.8%|Middle East|6.7%|5.5%|3.3%|five|EI","els-covid","","","31629079","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|LOC|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.ijid.2019.10.011","custom_license"

Methods A systematic literature search was carried out in Medline, Scielo, Lilacs, and Cochrane Library. The search strategy aimed at retrieving studies focusing on RSV prevalence, burden, risk factors, and the routine clinical practice in the prevention and management of RSV infections in Latin American countries. Only articles published between January 2011 and December 2017 were considered. Results Eighteen studies were included. Percentages of RSV detection varied highly across included studies for adult subjects with respiratory infections (0% to 77.9%), influenza-like illness (1.0% to 16.4%) and community-acquired pneumonia (1.3% to 13.5%). Considerable percentages of hospitalization were reported for RSV-infected adults with influenza-like illness (40.9% and 69.9%) and community-acquired pneumonia (91.7%). Conclusions Recent RSV data regarding adult populations in Latin America are scarce.

In order to treat patients at an early stage and prevent the diffusion of an outbreak, early diagnosis, and therefore fast and adequate detection, is needed. To this end, a multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction TaqMan method was designed to detect Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses simultaneously. Methods Two methods targeting different genome segments were selected from the literature for each virus. These were adapted for high genome coverage and combined in a four-plex assay that was thoroughly validated in-house. The SCREENED tool was used to evaluate the sequence coverage of the method. Results The full validation approach showed that the new four-plex method allows the specific and sensitive identification and discrimination of ZIKV and CHIKV in routine samples. The combination of two targets per virus allowing almost 100% coverage of about 500 genomes is shown for the first time. Conclusions PCR is a reliable user-friendly technique that can be applied in remote areas. Such multiplex methods enable early and efficient diagnosis, leading to rapid treatment and effective confinement in outbreak cases. They may also serve as an aid for surveillance, and the full validation permits easy method-transfer allowing worldwide harmonization.","05ea31d971a2dfb0fc8e6f9ab2e0fdcad1239712","True","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","Zika|ZIKV|CHIKV|Two|four-plex|SCREENED|four-plex|ZIKV|CHIKV|two|almost 100%|about 500|first","els-covid","","","31884173","PERSON|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|ORG|QUANTITY|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.ijid.2019.12.028","custom_license"

However, the benefit and cost-effectiveness vary in each country or community because they have different standard practices and health care systems. In Japan, rapid antigen tests (RATs) have been frequently used for pediatric respiratory infections. We investigated the impact and cost-effectiveness of a multiplex PCR (mPCR) respiratory panel for pediatric respiratory infections in a Japanese community hospital. Methods We replaced RATs with an mPCR respiratory panel (FilmArray®) for admitted pediatric respiratory infections on March 26, 2018. We compared the days of antimicrobial therapy (DOT) and length of stay (LOS) during the mPCR period (March 2018 to April 2019) with those of the RAT period (March 2012 to March 2018). Results During the RAT and mPCR periods, 1132 and 149 patients were analyzed. The DOT/case was 12.82 vs 8.56 (p < 0.001), and the LOS was 8.18 vs 6.83 days (p = 0.032) in the RAT and mPCR groups, respectively. The total costs during admissions were ∖258,824 ($2331.7) and ∖243,841 ($2196.8)/case, respectively. Pathogen detection rates were 30.2% vs 87.2% (p < 0.001). Conclusion Compared to conventional RATs, the mPCR test contributed to a reduction in the DOT and LOS in a Japanese community hospital for admission-requiring pediatric respiratory infections.

However, there is a lack of a method to simultaneously detect and distinguish PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels. In this study, we aimed to establish a dual ultrasensitive nanoparticle DNA probe-based PCR assay (dual UNDP-PCR) based on functionalized magnetic bead enrichment and specific nano-technology amplification for simultaneous detection and distinguish diagnosis of PEDV and TGEV. The detection limit of dual UNDP-PCR for single or multiple infections of PEDV and TGEV is 25 copies/g, which is 400 times more sensitive than the currently known duplex RT-PCR, showing better specificity and sensitivity without cross-reaction with other viruses. For pre-clinical fecal samples, the dual UNDP-PCR showed a markedly higher positive detection rate (52.08%) than conventional duplex RT-PCR (13.21%), can rapidly and accurately identify targeted pathogens whenever simple virus infection or co-infection. In summary, this study provides a technique for detecting and distinguishing PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels, which is high sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, low cost and broad application prospect.","61f531622904cf43fee07f406e71ea08b4f118de","True","Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","TGEV|two|TGEV|PCR|UNDP-PCR|PEDV|TGEV|PEDV|TGEV|25|400|RT-PCR|UNDP-PCR|52.08%|RT-PCR|13.21%|PEDV|TGEV","els-covid","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-05","","10.1016/j.jiac.2020.01.008","custom_license"
"Farag, N.S.; Breitinger, U.; Breitinger, H.G.; El Azizi, M.A.","Viroporins and inflammasomes: A key to understand virus-induced inflammation","Abstract Viroporins are virus encoded proteins that alter membrane permeability and can trigger subsequent cellular signals. Oligomerization of viroporin subunits results in formation of a hydrophilic pore which facilitates ion transport across host cell membranes. These viral channel proteins may be involved in different stages of the virus infection cycle. Inflammasomes are large multimolecular complexes best recognized for their ability to control activation of caspase-1, which in turn regulates the maturation of interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and interleukin 18 (IL-18). IL-1β was originally identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine able to induce both local and systemic inflammation and a febrile reaction in response to infection or injury. Excessive production of IL-1β is associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Microbial derivatives, bacterial pore-forming toxins, extracellular ATP and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns trigger activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Recent studies have reported that viroporin activity is capable of inducing inflammasome activity and production of IL-1β, where NLRP3 is shown to be regulated by fluxes of K+, H+ and Ca2+ in addition to reactive oxygen species, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The aim of this review is to present an overview of the key findings on viroporin activity with special emphasis on their role in virus immunity and as possible activators of inflammasomes.","c955ae9441b80b0959f0d8e618930ac7ecec18fa","True","The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology","caspase-1|18 (IL-18|Microbial|K+|H+","els-covid","","","","ORG|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-05-31","","10.1016/j.biocel.2020.105738","custom_license"
"Geddes, Duncan","The history of respiratory disease management","Abstract Over the past 200 years lung diseases have shifted from infections – tuberculosis, pneumonia – to diseases of dirty air – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and lung cancer. New diseases have emerged from industrial pollution and HIV infection, while better imaging has revealed others previously unrecognized. Scientific advances in microbiology, imaging and clinical measurement have improved diagnosis and allowed better targeted treatment. Advances in treatment have been dramatic, the most important being drugs (antibiotics, cortisone, β2-adrenoceptor agonists), ventilatory support (from iron lung to nasal positive-pressure ventilation), inhaled therapy (metered dose inhalers, nebulizers) and lung surgery (resections, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, transplantation). Delivery of care has shifted from sanatoria for the rich but nothing at all for the poor, to universal coverage in both primary and hospital care. Generalists have turned into super-specialists and doctors have been joined by growing numbers of professions allied to medicine. Management of lung disease has vastly improved but the impact of disease remains.","6a9a59c5cdaf90c49178a97e70859f8c0436216b","True","Medicine","the past 200 years","els-covid","","","","DATE","Elsevier","2020-03-04","","10.1016/j.mpmed.2020.01.007","custom_license"

Certain cutaneous Human Papillomaviruses seem to have a role as co-factors in the UV-induced carcinogenesis of the skin. The main mechanism of the tumorigenesis induced by Human Papillomaviruses is linked to the transforming activity of the viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins. However, other mechanisms, such as the gene expression control by specific microRNAs expression and deregulation of immune inflammatory mediators, may be important in the process of transformation. In this context, the release of Extracellular Vesicles with a specific cargo (microRNAs involved in tumorigenesis, mRNAs of viral oncoproteins, cytokines, chemokines) appears to play a key role.","669da067044d5f99db4af20331f4f776fff7f431","True","Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews","E7|Extracellular Vesicles","els-covid","","","31973992","ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.cytogfr.2019.12.009","custom_license"
"Sun, Qiangqiang; Leung, Wallace Woon-Fong","Enhanced nano-aerosol loading performance of multilayer PVDF nanofiber electret filters","Abstract Aerosol loading behavior of PVDF nanofiber electret filters using neutrally charged nano- and submicron aerosols was investigated experimentally for the first time. The loading behavior include variations of filtration efficiency and pressure drop and distribution of deposited aerosols in the filters all having the same fiber basis weight (3.060 gsm). Through the filtration efficiency variations of uncharged/charged, single-/multi-layer filters with aerosol loading, it was observed that mechanical PVDF filters had continuously increasing filtration efficiency, while PVDF electret filters had initially decreasing and subsequently increasing filtration efficiency until reaching 100% due to diminishing electrostatic effect and enhancing mechanical effect. By combining the pressure drop evolution of different filters during aerosol loading and detailed SEM images of the loaded filters, we have demonstrated that multilayer PVDF filters, especially the electret ones, could significantly slow down the pace of filter clogging (skin effect) and increase significantly the aerosol holding capacity during depth filtration. Generally, the multilayer nanofiber filters received the most aerosol deposit during depth filtration, whereas the single-layer nanofiber filters with the same basis weight of fibers received the most deposit during cake filtration. The multilayer nanofiber filters had approximately 70% aerosol deposit in the filter during depth filtration fully utilizing the full filter thickness, especially for the electret filters that had charged fibers, and only 30% deposit in the cake. On the contrary, the single-layer uncharged/charged nanofiber filters were exactly the reverse due to persistency of the skin effect with only 30% deposit in the filter mostly located in the upstream layer, yet 70% deposit in the cake. During depth filtration, the pressure drop per added mass deposit for the multilayer electret filter was very low at 11 Pa gsm−1, which was at least twice below any other nanofiber filters. This was all attributed to the uniform capture of aerosols by electrostatic effect across the entire filter depth from the upstream to downstream layers of the multilayer electret filter. The above conclusion was confirmed by the detailed SEM images taken across the different filter layers for the multilayer filter configuration. The 4-layer electret nanofiber filter with a 3.060-gsm basis weight has 4 times more aerosol holding capacity than the single uncharged/charged nanofiber filter with the same fiber basis weight in depth filtration. Based on the standpoint of highest efficiency and capacity with maximum pressure drop 800 Pa imposed on the filtration operation, the 4-layer nanofiber electret was the best among all 4 filters. It had 52% more aerosol holding capacity than the single layer uncharged nanofiber filter and 38% more capacity than the charged single-layer and the uncharged multilayer nanofiber filters. The multilayer PVDF electret filters have excellent filtration performance for long-term aerosol filtration and also great potential applications in the fields of personal health care and environmental protection.","dffdaf209eb2d761fa456d8a10a28d77c9980875","True","Separation and Purification Technology","PVDF|first|3.060|PVDF|PVDF|100%|SEM|PVDF|approximately 70%|only 30%|only 30%|70%|11|SEM|4-layer|4|800|4-layer|4|52%|38%|PVDF","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG","Elsevier","2020-06-01","","10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116606","custom_license"

Considering the availability of the RSV vaccines in the coming years, molecular understanding in RSV is necessary. Objective The objective of the present study was to describe RSV epidemiology and genotype variability in Portugal during the 2014/15-2017/18 period. Material and methods Epidemiological data and RSV-positive samples from patients with a respiratory infection were collected through the non-sentinel and sentinel influenza surveillance system (ISS). RSV detection, subtyping in A and B, and sequencing of the second hypervariable region (HVR2) of G gene were performed by molecular methods. Phylogenetic trees were generated using the Neighbor-Joining method and p-distance model on MEGA 7.0. Results RSV prevalence varied between the sentinel (2.5%, 97/3891) and the non-sentinel ISS (20.7%, 3138/16779), being higher (P < 0.0001) among children aged <5 years. Bronchiolitis (62.9%, 183/291) and influenza-like illness (24.6%, 14/57) were associated (P < 0.0001) with RSV laboratory confirmation among children aged <6 months and adults ≥65 years, respectively. The HVR2 was sequenced for 562 samples. RSV-A (46.4%, 261/562) and RSV-B (53.6%, 301/562) strains clustered mainly to ON1 (89.2%, 233/261) and BA9 (92%, 277/301) genotypes, respectively, although NA1 and BA10 were also present until 2015/2016.

HAdV were detected throughout the year with a higher prevalence in spring. 11 types were identified, with HAdV-2 (33.33%, 110/330) as the predominant type, followed by HAdV-3 (21.21%, 70/330) and HAdV-7 (13.94%, 46/330). Of the 330 HAdV-positive specimens, 247 (74.85%) were co-detected with other respiratory pathogens, most commonly rhinovirus (HRV) (58.7%, 145/247). Additionally, patients with HAdV-7 positive had longer duration of fever than HAdV-2 or -3 positive patients. Conclusions During the study period, HAdV-2, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 were the predominant types identified from children with ARTI in Hebei Province. Pediatric patients with HAdV-7 positive may not present more severe clinical outcome except a longer duration of fever.","371d7e7883a4ced834f4f1d385076ba9ad874a22","True","Journal of Clinical Virology","ARTI|HAdV|ARTI|China|HAdV|ARTI|Hebei|Northern China|June 2017|May 2018|12-month|HAdV|ARTI|SPSS|21.0|330|3.71%|8906|88.48%|292/330|3 years old|the year|spring|11|HAdV-2|33.33%|110/330|21.21%|70/330|HAdV-7|13.94%|46/330|330|247|74.85%|HRV|58.7%|HAdV-2|HAdV-2|HAdV-7|ARTI|Hebei Province|Pediatric","els-covid","","","31901884","PERSON|NORP|PERSON|GPE|ORG|PERSON|GPE|LOC|DATE|DATE|GPE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|NORP","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.jcv.2019.104254","custom_license"

While seasonal patterns of HPIV types 1–3 have been described, less is known about national patterns of HPIV-4 circulation. Objectives To describe patterns of HPIVs circulation in the United States (US). Study design We used data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS), a voluntary passive laboratory-based surveillance system, to characterize the epidemiology and circulation patterns of HPIVs in the US during 2011–2019. We summarized the number of weekly aggregated HPIV detections nationally and by US census region, and used a subset of data submitted to NREVSS from public health laboratories and several clinical laboratories during 2015–2019 to analyze differences in patient demographics. Results During July 2011 - June 2019, 2,700,135 HPIV tests were reported; 122,852 (5 %) were positive for any HPIV including 22,446 for HPIV-1 (18 %), 17,474 for HPIV-2 (14 %), 67,649 for HPIV-3 (55 %), and 15,283 for HPIV-4 (13 %). HPIV testing increased substantially each year. The majority of detections occurred in children aged ≤ 2 years (36 %) with fluctuations in the distribution of age by type. Conclusions HPIVs were detected year-round during 2011–2019, with type-specific year-to-year variations in circulation patterns. Among HPIV detections where age was known, the majority were aged ≤ 2 years. HPIV-4 exhibited an annual fall-winter seasonality, both nationally and regionally.

We aimed to explore the association between RV molecular subtyping, nasopharyngeal viral loads and viremia with childhood pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal and blood samples from cases and controls were tested for RV and the 5′ non-coding region sequenced. The cases compared to controls had a similar prevalence of RV detection in the nasopharynx (23 % vs. 22 %, P = 0.66), similar RV species distribution (A, B, C = 44 %, 8%, 44 % vs. 48 %, 7%, 38 %; respectively; P = 0.66) and similar viral load (4.0 and 3.7 log10 copies/mL, P = 0.062). However, RV-viremia was 4.01-fold (aOR 95 % CI: 1.26–12.78) more prevalent among cases (7%) than controls (2%), P = 0.019. Furthermore, among cases and controls RV-C was more commonly associated with viremia (14 % and 4%, P = 0.023), than RV-A (2% and 1%; P = 0.529).

Although people at the extremes of age have a greater risk of complications, influenza has been more frequently investigated in the elderly than in children, and inpatients than outpatients. Yearly vaccination with trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines is the main strategy to control influenza. Objectives Determine the clinical and molecular characteristics of influenza A and B infections in children and adolescents with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods A cohort of outpatient children and adolescents with ILI was followed for 20 months. Influenza was diagnosed with commercial multiplex PCR platforms. Results 179 patients had 277 episodes of ILI, being 79 episodes of influenza A and 20 episodes of influenza B. Influenza A and B cases were mild and had similar presentation. Phylogenetic tree of influenza B viruses showed that 91.6% belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, which is not included in trivalent vaccines. Conclusions Influenza A and B are often detected in children and adolescents with ILI episodes, with similar and mild presentation in outpatients. The mismatch between the circulating influenza viruses and the trivalent vaccine offered in Brazil may have contributed to the high frequency of influenza A and B in this population.","ac1f17e17eb06992a4fcbdefb8caf8292ab05f7d","True","The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases","Influenza|Yearly|Determine|ILI|ILI|20 months|Influenza|179|277|ILI|79|A and 20|91.6%|Influenza|ILI|Brazil","els-covid","","","31951818","ORG|DATE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|GPE","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.bjid.2019.12.005","custom_license"
"Kumar Rai, Prabhat; Singh, J.S.","Invasive alien plant species: Their impact on environment, ecosystem services and human health","Abstract Ecological perturbations caused by biotic invasion have been identified as a growing threat to global sustainability. Invasive alien plants species (IAPS) are considered to be one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss and thereby altering the ecosystem services and socio-economic conditions through different mechanisms. Although the ecological impacts of IAPS are well documented, there is a dearth of studies regarding their economic quantification, livelihood considerations, biotechnological prospects (phytoremediation, bioenergy, phyto-synthesis of nanoparticles, biomedical, industrial applications etc.) and human health risk assessments of IAPS. In this context, the current panoramic review aimed to investigate the environmental, socio-ecological and health risks posed by IAPS as well as the compounded impact of IAPS with habitat fragmentation, climate and land use changes. To this end, the need of an integrated trans-disciplinary research is emphasized for the sustainable management of IAPS. The management prospects can be further strengthened through their linkage with geo-spatial technologies (remote sensing and GIS) by mapping and monitoring the IAPS spread. Further, the horizon of IAPS management is expanded to ecological indicator perspectives of IAPS, biosecurity, and risk assessment protocols with critical discussion. Moreover, positive as well as negative implications of the IAPS on environment, health, ecosystem services and socio-economy (livelihood) are listed so that a judicious policy framework could be developed for the IAPS management in order to mitigate the human health implications.","2e75fa80bd3f3ac76fc0f1d5f0aa92987468e613","True","Ecological Indicators","IAPS|IAPS|IAPS|IAPS|IAPS|IAPS|GIS|IAPS|IAPS|IAPS|IAPS|IAPS","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-04-30","","10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.106020","custom_license"

To better inform programmes and policies focused on preventing and treating LRIs, we assessed the contributions and patterns of risk factor attribution, intervention coverage, and sociodemographic development in 195 countries and territories by drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) LRI estimates. Methods We used four strategies to model LRI burden: the mortality due to LRIs was modelled using vital registration data, demographic surveillance data, and verbal autopsy data in a predictive ensemble modelling tool; the incidence of LRIs was modelled using population representative surveys, health-care utilisation data, and scientific literature in a compartmental meta-regression tool; the attribution of risk factors for LRI mortality was modelled in a counterfactual framework; and trends in LRI mortality were analysed applying changes in exposure to risk factors over time. In GBD, infectious disease mortality, including that due to LRI, is among HIV-negative individuals. We categorised locations based on their burden in 1990 to make comparisons in the changing burden between 1990 and 2017 and evaluate the relative percent change in mortality rate, incidence, and risk factor exposure to explain differences in the health loss associated with LRIs among children younger than 5 years. Findings In 2017, LRIs caused 808 920 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 747 286–873 591) in children younger than 5 years. Since 1990, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths (from 2 337 538 to 808 920 deaths; 65·4% decrease, 61·5–68·5) and in mortality rate (from 362·7 deaths [330·1–392·0] per 100 000 children to 118·9 deaths [109·8–128·3] per 100 000 children; 67·2% decrease, 63·5–70·1). LRI incidence declined globally (32·4% decrease, 27·2–37·5). The percent change in under-5 mortality rate and incidence has varied across locations. Among the risk factors assessed in this study, those responsible for the greatest decrease in under-5 LRI mortality between 1990 and 2017 were increased coverage of vaccination against Haemophilus influenza type b (11·4% decrease, 0·0–24·5), increased pneumococcal vaccine coverage (6·3% decrease, 6·1–6·3), and reductions in household air pollution (8·4%, 6·8–9·2). Interpretation Our findings show that there have been substantial but uneven declines in LRI mortality among countries between 1990 and 2017. Although improvements in indicators of sociodemographic development could explain some of these trends, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors are related to the rates of decline in LRI mortality. No single intervention would universally accelerate reductions in health loss associated with LRIs in all settings, but emphasising the most dominant risk factors, particularly in countries with high case fatality, can contribute to the reduction of preventable deaths.

"Schakau, Vanessa; Hilker, Frank M.; Lewis, Mark A.","Fish disease dynamics in changing rivers: Salmonid Ceratomyxosis in the Klamath River","Abstract The myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa shasta has been identified as the main contributor of mortality in salmon in the Klamath River, California. The life cycle of the parasite is complex, involving a polychaete and a salmonid host. Infection dynamics are greatly influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature and water velocity. If we are to control the disease it is important to predict the impact of environmental scenarios on spore concentration and infection prevalence. Here, we introduce a model based on partial differential equations to study the spore concentration in the river and the infection prevalence of returning salmon. The analysis of the model shows that for current climate conditions, additional dam release can reduce the actinospore concentration up to 48% and the prevalence up to 40% thus providing a potential disease management option. However, the infection risk is likely to increase for future climate conditions by 10–54% and this will lead to an infection level comparable to that of a recent high-disease year. Our simulations show that dam removal cannot be assumed to mitigate the effect of climate change or to have influence on infection prevalence. We show that our detailed model system can be reduced to a simpler exponential dose-response function, which predicts infection levels based on transmission rates, travel time and mean spore concentration, quantities that can be measured in-situ or given empirically. The dose-response function may therefore be a useful tool in disease management.","f297ff6ac7a5dfde238e171ef3fff9a2c6e7877f","True","Ecological Complexity","Ceratomyxa|the Klamath River|California|48%|up to 40%|10–54%","els-covid","","","","ORG|LOC|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.ecocom.2019.100776","custom_license"

Method The study was conducted in hospitals in Makkah during the 2016 and 2017 Hajj seasons. Structured questionnaire was used to collect data on relevant indices on TB management and a scoring system was developed to assess compliance with guidelines. Results Data was collected from 31 TB cases, 65.4% (17/26) were Saudi residents. Sputum culture was the only diagnostic test applied in 67.7% (21/31) of patients. Most (96.8%, 30/31) confirmed TB cases were isolated, but only 12.9% (4/28) were tested for HIV and merely 37% (10/27) received the recommended four 1st-line anti-TB drugs. Guideline compliance scores were highest for infection prevention and control and surveillance (9.6/10) and identifying TB suspects (7.2/10). The least scores were obtained for treating TB (5.0/10) and diagnosing TB (3.0/10). Conclusions Healthcare providers training and supervision are paramount to improve their knowledge and skill and ensure their compliance with existing TB management guidelines.

Results Of 296 ill travelers, 51% were female and the median age was 54 years (range: 1–88). Over 82% returned from a religious mass gathering, most frequently Umrah or Hajj. Only 3% returned from the Olympics in Brazil or South Korea. Other mass gatherings included other sporting events, cultural or entertainment events, and conferences. Respiratory diseases accounted for almost 80% of all diagnoses, with vaccine preventable illnesses such as influenza and pneumonia accounting for 26% and 20% of all diagnoses respectively. This was followed by gastrointestinal illnesses, accounting for 4.5%. Sixty-three percent of travelers reported having a pre-travel encounter with a healthcare provider.

"Baharoon, Salim; Memish, Ziad A.","MERS-CoV as an emerging respiratory illness: A review of prevention methods","Abstract Introduction Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus Virus (MERS-CoV) first emerged from Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since been recognized as a significant human respiratory pathogen on a global level. Methods In this narrative review, we focus on the prevention of MERS-CoV. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, and Google Scholar, using the following terms: ‘MERS’, ‘MERS-CoV’, ‘Middle East respiratory syndrome’ in combination with ‘prevention’ or ‘infection control’. We also reviewed the references of each article to further include other studies or reports not identified by the search. Results As of Nov 2019, a total of 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were diagnosed mostly from Middle Eastern regions with a mortality rate of at least 35%. A major outbreak that occurred outside the Middle East (in South Korea) and infections reported from 27 countries. MERS-CoV has gained recognition as a pathogen of global significance. Prevention of MERS-CoV infection is a global public health priority. Healthcare facility transmission and by extension community transmission, the main amplifier of persistent outbreaks, can be prevented through early identification and isolation of infected humans. While MERS-CoV vaccine studies were initially hindered by multiple challenges, recent vaccine development for MERS-CoV is showing promise. Conclusions The main factors leading to sustainability of MERS-CoV infection in high risk courtiers is healthcare facility transmission. MERS-CoV transmission in healthcare facility mainly results from laps in infection control measures and late isolation of suspected cases. Preventive measures for MERS-CoV include disease control in camels, prevention of camel to human transmission.","e63fa82f7faa53fcf2eb7dda84a29e9baeb55b97","True","Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","first|Saudi Arabia|2012|PubMed|Embase|Cochrane|Scopus|Google Scholar|Middle East|syndrome’|Nov 2019|2468|Middle Eastern|at least 35%|the Middle East|South Korea|27|CoV|CoV|Healthcare|CoV|CoV|CoV|CoV|Preventive","els-covid","","","31730910","ORDINAL|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|LOC|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL|NORP|PERCENT|LOC|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.tmaid.2019.101520","custom_license"
"Shaban, Ramon Z.; Sotomayor-Castillo, Cristina F.; Malik, Jeremy; Li, Cecilia","Global commercial passenger airlines and travel health information regarding infection control and the prevention of infectious disease: What's in a website?","Abstract Background Air travel has never been easier, cheaper or faster, with large volumes of people travelling around the world. These factors increase the risk of the spread of infectious diseases by air travel. Little is known, however, about the extent to which airlines provide information to passengers on infection control and measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This study examined the websites of the global commercial passenger airlines to see if they contained information about infection control and prevention of infectious diseases and appraised the clinical usefulness of that information. Method A cross-sectional text-based analysis of the 73 airline websites from the six global commercial passenger airline conglomerates was performed to identify information about infection control and prevention of infectious between July and August 2019. Results Of the 73 airline websites, less than half (n = 35, 28.6%) contained information deemed useful for passengers. While there was a range of general health advice within the websites, there was limited information about infection control and preventing infectious diseases. A minority of websites contained information about vaccination status prior to travel, and to a lesser extent handwashing and hand hygiene, with very few including disease-specific advice or preventive measures. Conclusions Airline websites are an underutilised source of information for infection control and the prevention of infectious diseases. Providing passengers with information on basic infection control and prevention measures may support the global efforts against the spread of infectious diseases.","50efa168a690323ca0f0912288e1892a695ff0e9","True","Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","Method|73|six|between July and August 2019|73|less than half|35|28.6%|Conclusions Airline","els-covid","","","31760126","PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.tmaid.2019.101528","custom_license"

In 2018, two measles cases occurred in Berlin residents, who flew within Europe while being infectious. In addition to contact tracing through passenger manifests, we contacted national authorities in flight destination countries or embarking countries and inquired about epidemiologically linked measles cases to the two Berlin index cases. We identified eight epidemiologically linked cases (six males, median age: 32 years) from three countries associated with three air-travels. Consequently measles was imported to Germany (Bavaria), Denmark and possibly Sweden.

Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date. Methods We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Results 660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately. For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5–92.9%), cough (57.6%, 40.8–74.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 10.9–80.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations. Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0–30.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7–51.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1–9.3) with shock. Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2–21.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR). Conclusion COVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables unbiased detection of all potential pathogens. To apply mNGS in viral diagnostics, sensitive and simultaneous detection of RNA and DNA viruses is needed. Herein, were studied the performance of an in-house mNGS protocol for routine diagnostics of viral respiratory infections with potential for automated pan-pathogen detection. The sequencing protocol and bioinformatics analysis were designed and optimized, including exogenous internal controls. Subsequently, the protocol was retrospectively validated using 25 clinical respiratory samples. The developed protocol using Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing showed high repeatability. Use of the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s RefSeq database as opposed to the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s nucleotide database led to enhanced specificity of classification of viral pathogens. A correlation was established between read counts and PCR cycle threshold value. Sensitivity of mNGS, compared with PCR, varied up to 83%, with specificity of 94%, dependent on the cutoff for defining positive mNGS results. Viral pathogens only detected by mNGS, not present in the routine diagnostic workflow, were influenza C, KI polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, and enterovirus. Sensitivity and analytical specificity of this mNGS protocol were comparable to PCR and higher when considering off-PCR target viral pathogens. One single test detected all potential viral pathogens and simultaneously obtained detailed information on detected viruses.","10e25cb884018ca31d9f20c622817120a0135dad","True","The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics","Metagenomic|RNA|Herein|25|Illumina NextSeq|500|the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s|RefSeq|the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s|up to 83%|94%|KI|One","els-covid","","","31837435","GPE|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.jmoldx.2019.10.007","custom_license"

Design A retrospective, case-controlled study. Setting and participants A French nursing home for older adults between December 27, 2014 and January 20, 2015. Probable cases were residents presenting at least 1 respiratory symptom or 1 constitutional symptom. Confirmed cases identified in the same way as probable cases but with a positive RT-PCR test for hMPV. Controls were residents with no symptoms of respiratory infection. Measures Identification of hMPV was realized on nasal swab samples by RT-PCR. Results Seventy-eight older people were resident at the time of the outbreak. Three of the 4 tested were positive for hMPV by RT-PCR and negative for 13 other viruses or bacteria. All probable infected residents presented cough; other symptoms were scarcer. An inflammatory response was present, with median C-reactive protein at 50 mg/L. The median duration of the illness was 7 days. The rate of infection among residents was high (51%), with 5 hospitalizations (12.5%) and 1 death (2.5%). In multivariate analysis, vaccination against influenza virus appeared to emerge as associated with a probable hMPV infection, but this might be an artifact, as the proportion of unvaccinated residents was low (15%). A clear infected population profile was hard to define, although limited autonomy and low ADL score may play a role. Basic hygiene precautions were reinforced, but droplet precautions seemed difficult to apply rigorously to this population. Conclusions/Implications Clinical and biological presentations were nonspecific. The rate of infection was high, highlighting the need for the rapid introduction of strict precautions to contain the infection.","51493b0b75744eb4c140824fe17b1d83c6c5b172","True","Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","French|between December 27, 2014 and January 20, 2015|at least 1|1|RT-PCR|Controls|Identification|RT-PCR|Seventy-eight|Three|4|RT-PCR|13|50|7 days|51%|5|12.5%|1|2.5%|15%|ADL","els-covid","","","31101588","NORP|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.jamda.2019.03.015","custom_license"

Limited information exists on the virology of ARI in LTCFs, where virological testing is reactive. We report on findings of a surveillance feasibility substudy from a larger prospective trial of introducing rapid influenza diagnostic testing (RIDT) at 10 Wisconsin LTCFs. Any resident with symptoms consistent with ARI had a nasal swab specimen collected for RIDT by staff. Following RIDT, the residual swab was placed into viral transport medium and tested for influenza using Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and for 20 pathogens using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction respiratory pathogen panel. Numbers of viruses in each of 7 categories (influenza A, influenza B, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) across the 3 years were compared using χ2. Totals of 160, 215, and 122 specimens were collected during 2016‒2017, 2017‒2018, and 2018‒2019, respectively. Respiratory pathogen panel identified viruses in 54.8% of tested specimens. Influenza A (19.2%), influenza B (12.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (15.9%), and human metapneumovirus (20.9%) accounted for 69% of all detections, whereas coronaviruses (17.2%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (10.5%) and parainfluenza (3.8%) were less common. The distribution of viruses varied significantly across the 3 years (χ2 = 71.663; df = 12; P < .001). Surveillance in LTCFs using nasal swabs collected for RIDT is highly feasible and yields high virus identification rates. Significant differences in virus composition occurred across the 3 study years. Simple approaches to surveillance may provide a more comprehensive assessment of respiratory viruses in LTCF settings.","a298eb900e79f27b16c9a0b12cae2698c2d4eb54","True","Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","ARI|LTCFs|RIDT|10|Wisconsin|ARI|RIDT|RIDT|20|7|the 3 years|χ2|160|215|122|54.8%|Influenza|19.2%|12.6%|15.9%|20.9%|69%|17.2%|10.5%|3.8%|the 3 years|71.663|12|Surveillance|LTCFs|RIDT|years|LTCF","els-covid","","","31636034","ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.jamda.2019.09.003","custom_license"

Results A total of 676 patients were included, of which 169 patients were in the experimental group and 507 patients were in the control group. More than one-fourth (27.9%) of the patients in the experimental group tested positive for virus. Compared with controls, the experimental group had a significantly higher proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED (26.0% vs 16.1%, P = .007), neuraminidase inhibitor uses (8.9% vs 0.6%, P < .001), and shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics (10.0 vs 14.5 days, P < .001). Conclusions and Implications Combining rapid viral surveillance and PCT test is a useful strategy for early detection of potential viral epidemics and antibiotic stewardship. Clustered viral respiratory infections in a nursing home is common. Patients transferred from nursing homes to ED may benefit from this approach.","7115e78573daaa6ed64ecfbb559d1c558ec4579e","True","Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","between January 2017 and March 2018|ED|17|PCT|SARI|ED|secondary|676|169|507|More than one-fourth|27.9%|ED|26.0%|16.1%|.007|8.9% vs 0.6%|10.0 vs 14.5 days|Combining|PCT|ED","els-covid","","","31791902","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|PERSON|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","","10.1016/j.jamda.2019.09.020","custom_license"
"Mylotte, Joseph M.","Nursing Home-Associated Pneumonia, Part II: Etiology and Treatment","Abstract This is the second of 2 parts of a narrative review of nursing home-associated pneumonia (NHAP) that deals with etiology and treatment in the nursing home. In the 1980s and 1990s, the etiology of NHAP was considered to be similar to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This belief was reflected in CAP guidelines until 2005 when the designation healthcare-associated pneumonia or HCAP was introduced and nursing home residents were included in the HCAP category. Patients in the HCAP group were thought to be at high risk for pneumonia because of multidrug resistant organisms and required empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy much like people with hospital-acquired infection. Subsequent studies of the etiology of NHAP using sophisticated diagnostic testing found limited evidence of resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or resistant gram-negative organisms or atypical organisms. In terms of management of NHAP in the nursing home there are several considerations that are discussed: hospitalization decision, initial oral or parenteral therapy, timing of switch to an oral regimen if parenteral therapy is initially prescribed, duration of therapy with an emphasis on shorter courses, and follow-up during therapy including the use of the “antibiotic time out” protocol. The oral and parenteral antibiotic regimens recommended for treatment of NHAP in this report are based on limited information because there are no randomized controlled trials to define the optimum regimen. In conclusion, most residents with pneumonia can be treated successfully in the nursing home. However, there is an urgent need for a specific NHAP diagnosis and treatment guideline that will give providers guidance in the management of this infection in the nursing home.","845e0e1132ba012c351cb1384290f83c64560aff","True","Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","second|2|NHAP|the 1980s and 1990s|NHAP|CAP|CAP|2005|HCAP|HCAP|HCAP|NHAP|Staphylococcus|gram|NHAP|NHAP|NHAP","els-covid","","","32061505","ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.jamda.2020.01.012","custom_license"

This fatal disease is caused by JE Virus (JEV). The current study was carried out for designing a multi-epitope loaded peptide vaccine to prevent JEV. Based on reverse vaccinology and in silico approaches, octapeptide B-cell and hexapeptide T-cell epitopes belonging to five proteins, viz. E, prM, NS1, NS3 and NS5 of JEV were determined. Hydrophilicity, antigenicity, immunogenicity and aliphatic amino acids of the epitopes were estimated. Further, the epitopes were analyzed for different physicochemical parameters, e.g. total net charges, amino acid composition and Boman index. Out of all the epitopes, a total of four T-cell epitopes namely KRADSS, KRSRRS, SKRSRR and KECPDE and one B-cell epitope i.e. PKPCSKGD were found to have potential for raising immunity in human against the pathogen. Taking into account the outcome of this study, the pharmaceutical industries could initiate efforts to combine the identified epitopes together with adjuvant or carrier protein to develop a multi-epitope-loaded peptide vaccine against JEV. The peptide vaccine, being cost effective, could be administered as a prophylactic measure and in JEV infected individuals to combat the spread of this virus in human population. However, prior to administration into human beings, the vaccine must pass through several clinical trials.","1163230242bf54779c5e9bd79ab5a1afcfc14810","True","Infection, Genetics and Evolution","Japanese|JE Virus (JEV|JEV|five|NS1|Boman|four|KRADSS|KRSRRS|SKRSRR|KECPDE|one|PKPCSKGD|JEV|JEV","els-covid","","","31706079","NORP|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.meegid.2019.104106","custom_license"

We define three kinds of event relationships: temporal, content dependence, and event reference, that can be used to identify to what extent a component event is dependent on another in the evolution of a target event (i.e., the query event). The search results are organized as a temporal event map (TEM) that serves as the whole picture about an event’s evolution or development by showing the dependence relationships among events. Based on the event relationships in the TEM, we further propose a method to measure the degrees of importance of events, so as to discover the important component events for a query, as well as the several algebraic operators involved in the TEM, that allow users to view the target event. Experiments conducted on a real data set show that our method outperforms the baseline method Event Evolution Graph (EEG), and it can help discover certain new relationships missed by previous methods and even by human annotators.","d34c5f3a5f439702d5c04a9c11b8b5c18d869151","True","Applied Soft Computing","three|TEM|TEM|TEM|Event Evolution Graph|EEG","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.asoc.2019.105750","custom_license"

The aim of this work is to describe the 2017–2018 influenza season and how it affected elderly population in Catalonia despite moderate vaccine coverage among this age group. Methods Influenza surveillance based on a primary care sentinel surveillance, virological indicators systematic sampling of ILI attended and severe influenza confirmed cases (SHLCI) admitted to hospital. Analysis of data by Chi-squared, ANOVA, multiple regression and negative control test or case to case for vaccine effectiveness assessment in primary care and SHLCI respectively. Results Moderate-high intensity and early onset season with predominance of influenza B virus (IVB) (63%) followed by an increase of circulation of influenza A virus (IVA). A total of 419 IV from primary care samples. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) in primary care setting was 14% (95%CI: 0–47%). 1306 severe cases (adjusted cumulative incidence 18.54/100,000 inhabitants (95%CI: 17.54–19.55)).

Outcomes have historically been poor for the vast majority of patients who lack a matched sibling donor. However, the development of haploidentical HCT (haplo-HCT) with high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has allowed for curative long-term potential with favorable transplant-related outcomes, though this has not obviated the potential for graft rejection from human leukocyte antigen mismatch and repeated red blood cell transfusions. Accordingly, multiple strategies have been developed to improve outcomes, the majority of which are based on the Johns Hopkins platform from 2012. Presently, we aim to discuss results from pertinent studies and compare outcomes with the two most recent approaches involving either thiotepa plus 200-cGy total body irradiation or 400-cGy total body irradiation. Direct comparisons are required to determine the optimized curative potential.

The differences in clinical data and outcome between single and multiple viral infections in hospitalized children were analyzed. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of hospitalized children who had fever and a xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) test over a 2-year period. The clinical data were analyzed and compared between single and multiple viral infections. Viral etiologies in upper and lower respiratory infections were analyzed and compared. Results A total of 442 patients were enrolled. Patients with positive viral detection (N = 311) had a significantly lower rate of leukocytosis (p = 0.03), less evidence of bacterial infection (p = 0.004), and shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.019) than those with negative viral detection. The age of patients with multiple viral infections was younger than those with single viral infection; however, there were no significant differences in duration of fever, antibiotics treatment and hospitalization between these two groups. The most commonly identified virus was human rhinovirus. About 27% (n = 83) of patients had multiple viral infections. Overall, the highest percentage of human bocavirus infection was detected in multiple viral infections (79%). Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was independently associated with multiple viral infections (p = 0.022), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (p = 0.001) and longer hospitalization duration (p = 0.011). Conclusion Multiple viral infections were associated with younger age and a higher risk of developing LRTI. However, multiple viral infections did not predict a worse disease outcome.

Methods We evaluated a multiplex PCR assay panel, the FilmArray® pneumonia panel (FilmArray PP, BioFire Diagnostics), for detection of 35 respiratory pathogens and resistance determinants and compared the performance of the standard-of-care test in intensive care unit patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Results Among the 59 endotracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens obtained from 51 adult patients, FilmArray PP was effective in detecting respiratory bacterial pathogens with an overall positive percent agreement of 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.5–97.9%) and negative percent agreement of 97.4% (95% CI, 96.0–98.4%). FilmArray PP semi-quantitative reporting demonstrated a concordance rate of 53.6% for the culture-positive specimens and 86.3% for the culture-negative specimens. FilmArray PP detected 16 viral targets, whereas the conventional viral isolation failed, except influenza A, which showed 100% concordance with PCR. Coinfections were detected in 42.3% of the specimens. Substantial discrepancies were observed in identifying antimicrobial resistance gene targets and in the susceptibility testing. However, FilmArray PP may still be useful at the early stage of pneumonia before culture and susceptibility test reports are available. Consequently, the results of FilmArray PP might alter the antibiotic prescription in 40.7% of the patients. Conclusions FilmArray PP offers a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for lower respiratory tract infections. However, clinical correlation is advised to determine its significance in interpreting multiple pathogens and detection of genes involved in antimicrobial resistance.","426d6775eb996f739d136d5c479e4b723b2a490b","True","Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection","FilmArray|FilmArray PP|BioFire Diagnostics|35|59|51|FilmArray PP|90%|95%|CI|73.5–97.9%|negative percent|97.4%|95%|CI|96.0–98.4%|FilmArray PP|53.6%|86.3%|FilmArray PP|16|100%|42.3%|FilmArray PP|FilmArray PP|40.7%|Conclusions FilmArray PP","els-covid","","","31806539","ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|FAC|PERCENT|PERSON","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.jmii.2019.10.009","custom_license"

While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters. Methods We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. Results While COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-cohort of countries with higher medical standards. Further analyses demonstrate a significantly lower proportion of reported COVID-19 cases without travel history to China in countries with lower HAQ (HAQ I vs. HAQ II, posthoc p <0.01). Conclusions Our data indicate that countries with lower HAQ-index may either underreport COVID-19 cases or are unable to adequately detect them.

"Donati, Donatella","Viral infections and multiple sclerosis","The etiology and pathogenesis of MS is likely to involve multiple factors interacting with each other, and the role of infectious and viral agents is still under debate, however a consistent amount of studies suggests that some viruses are associated with the disease. The strongest documentation has come from the detection of viral nucleic acid or antigen or of an anti-viral antibody response in MS patients. A further step for the study of the mechanism viruses might be involved in can be made using in vitro and in vivo models. While in vitro models, based on glial and neural cell lines from various sources are widely used, in vivo animal models present challenges. Indeed neurotropic animal viruses are currently used to study demyelination in well-established models, but animal models of demyelination by human virus infection have only recently been developed, using animal gammaherpesviruses closely related to Epstein Barr virus (EBV), or using marmosets expressing the specific viral receptor for Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). The present review will illustrate the main potential mechanisms of MS pathogenesis possibly associated with viral infections and viruses currently used to study demyelination in animal models. Then the viruses most strongly linked with MS will be discussed, in the perspective that more than one virus might have a role, with varying degrees of interaction, contributing to MS heterogeneity.","faa52b8b14c7d1b1034774ef0e2c54c3a4041c68","True","Drug Discovery Today: Disease Models","Epstein Barr|Human Herpesvirus 6|more than one","els-covid","","","","PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-01","","10.1016/j.ddmod.2020.02.003","custom_license"

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.","54394b3d09418b2fbd79dbf8c04f6d18b2f96262","True","Epidemics","H1N1|Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome","els-covid","","","31624039","ORG|LOC","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.epidem.2019.100356","custom_license"

In this study, PEGylated micelles were designed and both micelles and Levofloxacin were radiolabeled with 99mTcO4 - to develop potential radiotracers for detection of infection/inflammation. Radiolabeling efficiency, in vitro stability and bacterial binding of 99mTc-Levofloxacin and 99mTc-micelles were compared. The aim of this study is to formulate and compare 99mTc-Levofloxacin and 99mTc-micelles as infection and inflammation agents having different mechanisms for the accumulation at infection and inflammation site. PEGylated micelles were designed with a particle size of 80 ± 0.7 nm and proper characterization properties. High radiolabeling efficiency was achieved for 99mTc-Levofloxacin (96%) and 99mTc-micelles (87%). The radiolabeling efficiency was remained stable with some insignificant alterations for both radiotracers at 25 °C for 24 h. Although in vitro bacterial binding of 99mTc-levofloxacine was higher than 99mTc-micelles, 99mTc-micelles may also be evaluated potential agent due to long circulation and passive accumulation mechanisms at infection/inflammation site. Both radiopharmaceutical agents exhibit potential results in design, characterization, radiolabeling efficiency and in vitro bacterial binding point of view.","7aa955f93531fe2c35d297e51b7e44bf03a4b856","True","Journal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology","Levofloxacin|99mTcO4|99mTc|99mTc-micelles|99mTc|99mTc-micelles|80 ± 0.7|99mTc|96%|99mTc|87%|25|24 h.|99mTc|99mTc-micelles|99mTc","els-covid","","","","GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|MONEY|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-04-30","","10.1016/j.jddst.2020.101571","custom_license"

Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity. In this study, antiviral activity examination of different resistant strains showed that the digestive juice of the resistant strain (A35) had higher inhibition to virus than the susceptible strain (P50). Subsequently, the label-free quantitative proteomics was used to study the midgut digestive juice response to BmNPV infection in P50 and A35 strains. A total of 98 proteins were identified, of which 80 were differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with 54 enzymes and 26 nonenzymatic proteins by comparing the proteomes of infected and non-infected P50 and A35 silkworms. These DEPs are mainly involved in metabolism, proteolysis, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, starch and sucrose metabolism and glutathione metabolism. After removing the genetic background and individual immune stress response proteins, 9 DEPs were identified potentially involved in resistance to BmNPV. Further studies showed that a serine protease, an alkaline phosphatase and serine protease inhibitor 2 isoform X1 were differentially expressed in A35 compared to P50 or post BmNPV infection. Taken together, these results provide insights into the potential mechanisms for silkworm digestive juice to provide resistance to BmNPV infection. Signifcance: Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is highly pathogenic, which has a great impact on the sericulture. BmNPV entered the midgut lumen and exposed to digestive juices after oral infection. Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity, however, current information on the digestive juice proteome of high resistant silkworm strain after BmNPV challenge compared to susceptible strain is incomprehensive. Here, we combined label-free quantification method, bioinformatics, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis and found that BmNPV infection causes some protein changes in the silkworm midgut digestive juice. The DEPs were identified in the digestive juices of different resistant strains following BmNPV infection, and screened out some proteins potentially related to resistance to BmNPV. Three important differentially expression proteins were validated by independent approaches. These findings uncover the potential role of silkworm digestive juice in providing resistance to BmNPV and supplemented the profile of the proteome of the digestive juices in B. mori.","39a3c99814a041252c86cfcf914e729429f46ffb","True","Journal of Proteomics","BmNPV|A35|P50|BmNPV|P50|A35|98|80|54|26|P50|A35|9|BmNPV|2|X1|A35|P50|BmNPV|BmNPV|BmNPV|BmNPV|BmNPV|RT|BmNPV|BmNPV|BmNPV|Three|BmNPV","els-covid","","","31610263","GPE|GPE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE","Elsevier","2020-01-06","","10.1016/j.jprot.2019.103527","custom_license"

The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework aims to improve the sharing of influenza viruses with pandemic potential and increase access of developing countries to vaccines and other life-saving products during a pandemic. Under the Framework, countries have been supported to enhance their capacities to detect, prepare for and respond to pandemic influenza. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, seven countries are priority countries for Laboratory and Surveillance (L&S) support: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Yemen. During 2014–2017, US$ 2.7 million was invested in regional capacity-building and US$ 4.6 million directly in the priority countries. Countries were supported to strengthen influenza diagnostic capacities to improve detection, enhance influenza surveillance systems including sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness, and increase global sharing of surveillance data and influenza viruses. This paper highlights the progress made in improving influenza preparedness and response capacities in the Region from 2014 to 2017, and the challenges faced. By 2017, 18 of the 22 countries of the Region had laboratory-testing capacity, 19 had functioning sentinel influenza surveillance systems and 22 had trained national rapid response teams. The number of countries correctly identifying all influenza viruses in the WHO external quality assurance panel increased from 9 countries scoring 100% in 2014 to 15 countries in 2017, and the number sharing influenza viruses with WHO collaborating centres increased by 75% (from eight to 14 countries); more than half now share influenza data with regional or global surveillance platforms. Seven countries have estimated influenza disease burden and seven have introduced influenza vaccination for high-risk groups. Challenges included: protracted complex emergencies faced by nine countries which hindered implementation of influenza surveillance in areas with the most needs, high staff turnover, achieving timely virus sharing and limited utilization of influenza data where they are available to inform vaccine policies or establish threshold values to measure the start and severity of influenza seasons.","680db4e858f7593c9fb07c550cb08669d725f7be","True","Journal of Infection and Public Health","Influenza|the Eastern Mediterranean Region|The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework|the Eastern Mediterranean Region|seven|Laboratory|Surveillance (L&S|Afghanistan|Djibouti|Egypt|Jordan|Lebanon|Morocco|Yemen|2014–2017|US$ 2.7 million|US$ 4.6 million|2014|2017|2017|18|22|19|22|WHO|9|100%|2014|15|2017|WHO|75%|eight|14|more than half|Seven|seven|nine","els-covid","","","30905541","ORG|LOC|ORG|LOC|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|MONEY|MONEY|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.jiph.2019.03.006","custom_license"
"Ahmed, Anwar E.","Diagnostic delays in Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus patients and health systems","Abstract Background Although Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) diagnostic delays remain a major challenge in health systems, the source of delays has not been recognized in the literature. The aim of this study is to quantify patient and health-system delays and to identify their associated factors. Methods The study of 266 patients was based on public source data from the World Health Organization (WHO) (January 2, 2017–May 16, 2018). The diagnostic delays, patient delays, and health-system delays were calculated and modelled using a Poisson regression analysis. Results In 266 MERS-CoV patients reported during the study period, the median diagnostic delays, patient delays, and health-system delays were 5 days (interquartile [IQR] range: 3–8 days), 4 days (IQR range: 2–7 days), and 2 days (IQR range: 1–2 days), respectively. Both patient delay (r = 0.894, P = 0.001) and health-system delay (r = 0.163, P = 0.025) were positively correlated with diagnostic delay. Older age was associated with longer health-system delay (adjusted relative ratios (aRR), 1.011; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.004–1.017). Diagnostic delay (aRR, 1.137; 95% CI, 1.006–1.285) and health-system delays (aRR, 1.217; 95% CI, 1.003–1.476) were significantly longer in patients who died. Conclusion Delays in MERS-CoV diagnosis exist and may be attributable to patient delay and health-system delay as both were significantly correlated with longer diagnosis delay. Early MERS-CoV diagnosis may require more sensitive risk assessment tools to reduce avoidable delays, specifically those related to patients and health system.","b1b58a2b803ac6e88b012b240c7337f294816ff2","True","Journal of Infection and Public Health","Middle East|266|the World Health Organization|January 2, 2017–May 16, 2018|Poisson|266|CoV|5 days|3–8 days|4 days|2–7 days|2 days|1–2 days|0.894|0.001|0.163|0.025|aRR|1.011|95%|CI|1.004–1.017|1.137|95%|CI|1.006–1.285|1.217|95%|CI|1.003–1.476|CoV|CoV","els-covid","","","31006635","LOC|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.jiph.2019.04.002","custom_license"

"Sohrab, Sayed S.; Azhar, Esam I.","Genetic diversity of MERS-CoV spike protein gene in Saudi Arabia","Abstract Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was primarily detected in 2012 and still causing disease in human and camel. Camel and bats have been identified as a potential source of virus for disease spread to human. Although, significant information related to MERS-CoV disease, spread, infection, epidemiology, clinical features have been published, A little information is available on the sequence diversity of Spike protein gene. The Spike protein gene plays a significant role in virus attachment to host cells. Recently, the information about recombinant MERS-CoV has been published. So, this work was designed to identify the emergence of any another recombinant virus in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Methods In this study samples were collected from both human and camels and the Spike protein gene was amplified and sequenced. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of MERS-CoV Spike protein gene were used to analyze the recombination, genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship with selected sequences from Saudi Arabia. Results The nucleotide sequence identity ranged from 65.7% to 99.8% among all the samples collected from human and camels from various locations in the Kingdom. The lowest similarity (65.7%) was observed in samples from Madinah and Dammam. The phylogenetic relationship formed different clusters with multiple isolates from various locations. The sample collected from human in Jeddah hospital formed a closed cluster with human samples collected from Buraydah, while camel sample formed a closed cluster with Hufuf isolates. The phylogenetic tree by using Aminoacid sequences formed closed cluster with Dammam, Makkah and Duba isolates. The amino acid sequences variations were observed in 28/35 samples and two unique amino acid sequences variations were observed in all samples analyzed while total 19 nucleotides sequences variations were observed in the Spike protein gene. The minor recombination events were identified in eight different sequences at various hotspots in both human and camel samples using recombination detection programme. Conclusion The generated information from this study is very valuable and it will be used to design and develop therapeutic compounds and vaccine to control the MERS-CoV disease spread in not only in the Kingdom but also globally.","575eb53a312d827a688f809be60e1eb0bc52d99d","True","Journal of Infection and Public Health","Middle East|2012|Camel|CoV|CoV|Jeddah|Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia|65.7%|99.8%|Kingdom|65.7%|Madinah|Dammam|Jeddah|Buraydah|Hufuf|Aminoacid|Dammam|Makkah|Duba|28/35|two|19|eight|Kingdom","els-covid","","","31831395","LOC|DATE|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-09","","10.1016/j.jiph.2019.11.007","custom_license"
"Altamimi, Asmaa; Ahmed, Anwar E.","Climate factors and incidence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Abstract Background Our understanding of climate factors and their links to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks is incomplete. This study aimed to estimate the monthly incidence of MERS-CoV cases and to investigate their correlation to climate factors. Methods The study used aggregated monthly MERS-CoV cases that reported to the Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control from the Riyadh Region between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. Data on the meteorological situation throughout the study period was calculated based on Google reports on the Riyadh Region (24.7136°N, 46.6753°E). The Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each climate factor. Results A total of 712 MERS-CoV cases were included in the analysis (mean age 54.2±9.9 years), and more than half (404) (56.1%) MERS-CoV cases were diagnosed during a five-month period from April to August. The highest peak timing positioned in August 2015, followed by April 2014, June 2017, March 2015, and June 2016. High temperatures (IRR=1.054, 95% CI: 1.043–1.065) and a high ultraviolet index (IRR=1.401, 95% CI: 1.331–1.475) were correlated with a higher incidence of MERS-CoV cases. However, low relative humidity (IRR=0.956, 95% CI: 0.948–0.964) and low wind speed (IRR=0.945, 95% CI: 0.912–0.979) were correlated with a lower incidence of MERS-CoV cases. Conclusion The novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, is influenced by climate conditions with increasing incidence between April and August. High temperature, high ultraviolet index, low wind speed, and low relative humidity are contributors to increased MERS-CoV cases. The climate factors must be evaluated in hospitals and community settings and integrated into guidelines to serve as source of control measures to prevent and eliminate the risk of infection.","9c1053307730d617cc748e9ede0e890fa06a992e","True","Journal of Infection and Public Health","the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus|monthly|monthly|CoV|the Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control|the Riyadh Region|between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018|Google|the Riyadh Region|24.7136|°N|46.6753|Poisson|IRR|95%|CI|712|CoV|age 54.2±9.9 years|more than half|404|56.1%|CoV|five-month|April to August|August 2015|April 2014, June 2017|March 2015|June 2016|IRR=1.054|95%|CI|1.043–1.065|IRR=1.401|95%|CI|1.331–1.475|CoV|IRR=0.956|95%|CI|0.948–0.964|95%|CI|CoV|CoV|between April and August","els-covid","","","","ORG|DATE|DATE|PERSON|ORG|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|PERSON|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|DATE","Elsevier","2019-12-06","","10.1016/j.jiph.2019.11.011","custom_license"

Current evidence confirms the role of dromedaries in primary human infections but does not explain the sporadic community cases. However, asymptomatic or subclinical cases could represent a possible source of infection in the community. Methods Archived human sera (7461) collected between 2011 and 2016 from healthy adult blood donors from 50 different nationalities in the western part of Saudi Arabia were obtained for MERS-CoV seroprevalence investigation. Samples were tested for MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies (Abs) by ELISA and confirmed by testing for neutralizing Abs (nAbs) using both pseudotyped and live virus neutralization assays. Results Out of 7461 samples, 174 sera from individuals with 18 different nationalities were ELISA positive (2.3%, 95% CI 2.0–2.7). Presence of nAbs was confirmed in 17 samples (0.23%, 95% CI 0.1–0.4) of which one sample exhibited positivity in both neutralization assays. Confirmed seropositivity was identified in young (15–44 years) men and women from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, and India without significant preference. Conclusions An increasing trend of MERS-CoV seroprevalence was observed in the general population in western Saudi Arabia, suggesting that asymptomatic or mild infections might exist and act as an unrecognized source of infection. Seropositivity of individuals from different nationalities underscores the potential MERS exportation outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, enhanced and continuous surveillance is highly warranted.","9d8156ce40964d8f4633ff44679acbd275f66370","True","Journal of Infection and Public Health","Middle East|Methods Archived|7461|between 2011 and 2016|50|Saudi Arabia|CoV|Abs|ELISA|Abs|nAbs|7461|174|18|ELISA|2.3%|95%|CI|nAbs|17|0.23%|95%|CI|one|15–44 years|Saudi Arabia|Egypt|Yemen|Pakistan|Palestine|Sudan|India|CoV|Saudi Arabia|the Arabian Peninsula","els-covid","","","","LOC|PERSON|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|GPE|PERSON|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|GPE|LOC","Elsevier","2020-01-28","","10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.001","custom_license"

Media speculations may have increased this psychological distress. The healthcare community was the most distressed because they were at the highest risk of infection. This study is the first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students’ perception and determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak. Methods We randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A predesigned questionnaire was answered by participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed. Results One hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher mean stress level than males (P < 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7 ± 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4 ± 4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). The stress level (as reported on 1–10 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV. Conclusions Medical students’ psychological needs during the MERS-CoV outbreak should be addressed appropriately. Our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs for medical students during an infectious disease outbreak.","3a76cfcb2772d209f1eb0ab9f48d3edda2c4fdd7","True","Journal of Infection and Public Health","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus|2014|Media|first|CoV|students’|200|the College of Medicine|King Saud University|Riyadh|Saudi Arabia|One hundred and seventy-four|87%|0.001|GAD|2.7 ± 3.1|2|17.4 ± 4.2|18|25.4%|One hundred and thirty-four|77%|thirty-two|18.4%|8|4.6%|14|1–10|Generalized Anxiety Disorder|GAD-7|CoV|CoV","els-covid","","","","ORG|DATE|ORG|ORDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|MONEY|CARDINAL|MONEY|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|PERSON|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-01-27","","10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.005","custom_license"

Our objective was to determine if a family's preferred language of Spanish versus English was associated with differences in management of bronchiolitis in the PED. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of children ≤2 years old diagnosed with bronchiolitis in a PED over a 7-year period. Rates of PED testing, interventions, and disposition among children whose families’ preferred language was Spanish were compared to children whose families’ preferred language was English. Primary outcomes were frequencies of chest x-ray and bronchodilator orders. Secondary outcomes were diagnostic testing, medication orders, and disposition. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios after controlling for age, emergency severity index, prior visit, and nesting within attending physicians. Results A total of 13,612 encounters were included. Spanish-speaking families were more likely to have chest x-rays (35.8% vs 26.7%, P < .0001; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–1.9), complete blood counts (8.2% vs 4.9%, P < .005; aOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2–2.5), and blood cultures ordered (8.1% vs 5.0%, P < .05; aOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2–2.4). No other differences in bronchodilators, medication orders, or disposition were found between the 2 groups. Conclusions Among children diagnosed with bronchiolitis, Spanish-speaking families were more likely to have chest x-rays, complete blood counts, and blood cultures ordered compared to English-speaking families. Further research on how clinical practice guidelines and equity-focused guidelines can impact disparities in diagnostic testing within the PED is warranted.","b9a44766665d8aad107171c59c93e54f896b2836","True","Academic Pediatrics","PED|the American Academy of Pediatrics|Spanish|English|PED|years|PED|7-year|PED|Spanish|English|13,612|Spanish|35.8%|26.7%|1.5|95%|CI|8.2% vs 4.9%|1.7|95%|CI 1.2–2.5|8.1%|5.0%|1.7|95%|CI|2|Spanish|English|PED","els-covid","","","31981655","ORG|ORG|LANGUAGE|LANGUAGE|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|LANGUAGE|CARDINAL|LANGUAGE|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|LANGUAGE|LANGUAGE|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-22","","10.1016/j.acap.2020.01.006","custom_license"

However, pharmacists’ duty of care at this interface has not been fully explored. This qualitative study aimed to explore key stakeholders’ perceptions about the challenges and enablers to pharmacists’ adopting a professional role in patient care associated with the concurrent use of herbal medicines (HMs). Methods Participants were recruited from the expert pool of the National Research Center for Licensed Pharmacist Development using purposive sampling and snowballing. Participants targeted included government, academics and practicing pharmacists. An interview guide was developed following a literature review and face-to-face, audiotaped interviews conducted with key stakeholders. Results Fourteen semi-structured interviews with both practicing pharmacists and key stakeholder representatives were conducted in China in 2017. Thematic analysis identified 6 main themes which focused on how TCM was integrated with WM in China. Participants agreed that pharmacists should at least assume a role in drug safety associated with concurrent use of TCM and WM. However, barriers were identified within the government, education, pharmacy, pharmacist and research sectors, indicating a lack of coordinated strategies to improve this area of healthcare. A lack of clarity in defining the pharmacists’ role in this area and a disconnect between current regulatory standards and education/training system were the prominent themes. Participants looked towards the government to facilitate actions in the development of policies that support pharmacy practice and practice guidelines, and the review of competency standards, and registration criteria as being the most important enablers. Conclusion Guiding principles that outline standards for pharmacy practice regarding HMs in an integrated healthcare system are considered a priority, requiring a joint effort from the government, professional organizations and universities.","449e0bfff2346cc5c155a85d259dbc5bb425f27f","True","European Journal of Integrative Medicine","China|Traditional Chinese Medicine|TCM|Western|pharmacists’|pharmacists’|the National Research Center for Licensed Pharmacist Development|Fourteen|China|2017|Thematic|6|TCM|WM|China|TCM|WM|pharmacists’|Conclusion Guiding","els-covid","","","","GPE|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101063","custom_license"

The medicinal quality of herbal plants varies with the locations of cultivation, the parts of the herb collected, the season of the herb collected, and the herb processing method. Polysaccharides are major components of the herb plants and their biosynthesis is partly controlled by the genes but mostly influenced by the availability of the nutrition and determined by the various environmental factors. In recent decades, polysaccharides isolated from different kinds of Chinese herbs have received much attention due to their important biological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, radiation protecting, antiviral, hypolipidemic, and immunomodulatory activities. Interestingly, different batches of the same herb can obtain different polysaccharide fractions with subtle differences in molecular weight, monosaccharide compositions, glycosidic linkages, and biological functions. Even with these variations, a large number of bioactive polysaccharides from different kinds of traditional Chinese herbs have been purified, characterized, and reported. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the latest polysaccharide extraction methods and the strategies used for monosaccharide compositional analysis plus polysaccharide structural characterization. Most importantly, the reported chemical characteristics and biological activities of the polysaccharides from the famous traditional Chinese herbs including Astragalus membranaceus, Ginseng, Lycium barbarum, Angelica sinensis, Cordyceps sinensis, and Ophiopogon japonicus will be reviewed and discussed. The published studies provide evidence that polysaccharides from traditional Chinese herbs play an important role in their medical applications, which forms the basis for future research, development, and application of these polysaccharides as functional foods and therapeutics in modern medicine.","0c137574e50a7761a78cd76c956e8547efa3c1b7","True","Progress in Molecular Biology and Translational Science","Chinese|recent decades|Chinese|Chinese|Chinese|Ginseng|Lycium|Angelica|Ophiopogon|Chinese","els-covid","","","31030757","NORP|DATE|NORP|NORP|NORP|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/bs.pmbts.2019.03.003","custom_license"

"Liu, Xu; Fuentes, Ernesto J.","Chapter Five Emerging Themes in PDZ Domain Signaling Structure, Function, and Inhibition","Abstract Post-synaptic density-95, disks-large and zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domains are small globular protein–protein interaction domains widely conserved from yeast to humans. They are composed of ∼90 amino acids and form a classical two α-helical/six β-strand structure. The prototypical ligand is the C-terminus of partner proteins; however, they also bind internal peptide sequences. Recent findings indicate that PDZ domains also bind phosphatidylinositides and cholesterol. Through their ligand interactions, PDZ domain proteins are critical for cellular trafficking and the surface retention of various ion channels. In addition, PDZ proteins are essential for neuronal signaling, memory, and learning. PDZ proteins also contribute to cytoskeletal dynamics by mediating interactions critical for maintaining cell–cell junctions, cell polarity, and cell migration. Given their important biological roles, it is not surprising that their dysfunction can lead to multiple disease states. As such, PDZ domain–containing proteins have emerged as potential targets for the development of small molecular inhibitors as therapeutic agents. Recent data suggest that the critical binding function of PDZ domains in cell signaling is more than just glue, and their binding function can be regulated by phosphorylation or allosterically by other binding partners. These studies also provide a wealth of structural and biophysical data that are beginning to reveal the physical features that endow this small modular domain with a central role in cell signaling.","b0c4f1bdd3fe67c3d7501a7b2fbfc78f53c0d34f","True","International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology","density-95|PDZ|∼90|two|six|PDZ|PDZ|PDZ|PDZ|PDZ|PDZ","els-covid","","","30712672","PERSON|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/bs.ircmb.2018.05.013","custom_license"

In the meantime, however, metagenomic sequencing efforts are revealing enteric viruses as the most abundant dimension of the intestinal gut ecosystem, and the first gut virome-wide association studies showed that inflammatory bowel disease as well as type 1 diabetes could be linked to the presence or absence of particular viral inhabitants in the intestine. In line with the genetic component of these human diseases, mouse model studies demonstrated how beneficial functions of a resident virus can switch to detrimental inflammatory effects in a genetically predisposed host. Such viral-induced intestinal immune disturbances are also recapitulated by several gastrointestinal infectious viruses such as rotavirus and human norovirus. This wide range of viral effects on intestinal immunity emphasizes the need for understanding the innate immune responses to gastrointestinal viruses. Numerous nucleic acid sensors such as DexD/H helicases and AIM2 serve as cytosolic viral guardians to induce antiviral interferon and/or pro-inflammatory inflammasome responses. In both cases, pioneering examples are emerging in which RNA helicases cooperate with particular Nod-like receptors to trigger these cellular responses to enteric viruses. Here we summarize the reported beneficial versus detrimental effects of enteric viruses in the intestinal immune system, and we zoom in on the mechanisms through which sensing of nucleic acids from these enteric viruses trigger interferon and inflammasome responses.","30301bcd3567e19053512074c2448762cc032e1f","True","International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology","first|1|DexD/H|RNA|Nod","els-covid","","","30904192","ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|NORP","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/bs.ircmb.2018.08.003","custom_license"
"Kawasaki, Takumi; Kawai, Taro","Chapter One Discrimination Between Self and Non-Self-Nucleic Acids by the Innate Immune System","Abstract During viral and bacterial infections, the innate immune system recognizes various types of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as nucleic acids, via a series of membrane-bound or cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors. These include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), AIM2-like receptors (ALRs), and cytosolic DNA sensors. The binding of PAMPs to these receptors triggers the production of type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines. Type I IFN induces the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), which protect surrounding cells from infection. Some ISGs are nucleic acids-binding proteins that bind viral nucleic acids and suppress their replication. As nucleic acids are essential components that store and transmit genetic information in every species, infectious pathogens have developed systems to escape from the host nucleic acid recognition system. Host cells also have their own nucleic acids that are frequently released to the extracellular milieu or the cytoplasm during cell death or stress responses, which, if able to bind pattern-recognition receptors, would induce autoimmunity and inflammation. Therefore, host cells have acquired mechanisms to protect themselves from contact with their own nucleic acids. In this review, we describe recent research progress into the nucleic acid recognition mechanism and the molecular bases of discrimination between self and non-self-nucleic acids.","b54cb4255fa62b88defc1f51d8fc3273d808b9fc","True","International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology","RIG|PAMPs|IFN","els-covid","","","30798985","GPE|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/bs.ircmb.2018.08.004","custom_license"
"Imre, Gergely","The involvement of regulated cell death forms in modulating the bacterial and viral pathogenesis","Abstract Apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis represent three distinct types of regulated cell death forms, which play significant roles in response to viral and bacterial infections. Whereas apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, bleb formation and retained membrane integrity, necroptosis and pyroptosis exhibit osmotic imbalance driven cytoplasmic swelling and early membrane damage. These three cell death forms exert distinct immune stimulatory potential. The caspase driven apoptotic cell demise is considered in many circumstances as anti-inflammatory, whereas the two lytic cell death modalities can efficiently trigger immune response by releasing damage associated molecular patterns to the extracellular space. The relevance of these cell death modalities in infections can be best demonstrated by the presence of viral proteins that directly interfere with cell death pathways. Conversely, some pathogens hijack the cell death signaling routes to initiate a targeted attack against the immune cells of the host, and extracellular bacteria can benefit from the destruction of intact extracellular barriers upon cell death induction.

"Ilyas, Fatima; Burbridge, Brent; Babyn, Paul","Health Care–Associated Infections and the Radiology Department","Abstract Health care–associated infections (HCAIs) are a significant concern for both health care workers (HCWs) and patients. They are a major contributing factor of disease in industrialized countries, and are responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and a direct annual financial loss of $6-7 billion in North America alone. They are an increasingly challenging health issue due to multidrug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci among others, along with an increasing number of susceptible patients. Over the last three decades, the risk of HCAIs has increased in the radiology department (RD) in part because of an increased number of patients visiting the department and an increase in the utilization of imaging modalities. In this review, we will discuss how patients and staff can be exposed to HCAIs in the RD, including contaminated inanimate surfaces, radiology equipment, and associated medical devices. As the role of medical imaging has extended from primarily diagnosis to include more interventions, the implementation and development of standardized infection minimization protocols and infection control procedures are vital in the RD, particularly in interventional radiology. With globalisation and the rapid movement of people regionally, nationally, and globally, there is greater risk of exposure to contagious diseases such as Ebola, especially if infected patients are undiagnosed when they travel. For effective infection control, advanced training and education of HCWs in the RD is essential. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of HCAIs as related to activities of the RD. We will discuss the following major topics including the variety of HCAIs commonly encountered, the role of the RD in HCAIs, transmission of infections to patients and HCWs in the RD, standard infection prevention measures, and the management of susceptible/infected patients in the RD. We shall also examine the role of, and the preparedness of, HCWs, including RD technologists and interventional radiologists, who may be exposed to undiagnosed, yet infected patients. We shall conclude with a brief discussion of the role of further research related to HCAIs. Learning Objectives After the completion of this review article, the readers will • Understand the exposure and role of radiology department in health care–associated infections, • Know the causes/modes/transmission of infections in radiology department, • Be conscious of standard disinfection protocols, • Be aware of current and future strategies required for the effective control of health care–associated infection in the radiology department. This is a CME article and provides the equivalent of 2 hours of continuing education that may be applied to your professional development credit system.

Therefore, rapid and a accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people’s lives and preventing epidemics. It is important to establish a quick standard diagnostic test for the detection of the infectious disease (COVID-19) to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is regarded as a gold standard test for the molecular diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and specificity. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is considered to be a highly promising candidate method due to its fundamental advantage in quick procedure time at constant temperature without thermocycler operation. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. This review summarizes the currently available detection methods for coronavirus nucleic acid. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection.","4f87b8e62fd15ce226b91fe8753a3cb932f0826a","True","Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis","Chinais|COVID-19","els-covid","","","","PERSON|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-03-01","","10.1016/j.jpha.2020.02.010","custom_license"
"Wathes, D. Claire; Oguejiofor, Chike F.; Thomas, Carole; Cheng, Zhangrui","Importance of Viral Disease in Dairy Cow Fertility","Abstract Many viral diseases are endemic in cattle populations worldwide. The ability of many viruses to cross the placenta and cause abortions and fetal malformations is well understood. There is also significant evidence that viral infections have additional actions in dairy cows, which are reflected in reduced conception rates. These effects are, however, highly dependent on the time at which an individual animal first contracts the disease and are less easy to quantify. This paper reviews the evidence relating to five viruses that can affect fertility, together with their potential mechanisms of action. Acute infection with non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in mid-gestation increases abortion rates or causes the birth of persistently infected calves. BVDV infections closer to the time of breeding can have direct effects on the ovaries and uterine endometrium, which cause estrous cycle irregularities and early embryo mortality. Fertility may also be reduced by BVDV-induced immunosuppression, which increases the susceptibility to bacterial infections. Bovine herpesvirus (BHV)-1 is most common in pre-pubertal heifers, and can slow their growth, delay breeding, and increase the age at first calving. Previously infected animals subsequently show reduced fertility. Although this may be associated with lung damage, ovarian lesions have also been reported. Both BHV-1 and BHV-4 remain latent in the host following initial infection and may be reactivated later by stress, for example associated with calving and early lactation. While BHV-4 infection alone may not reduce fertility, it appears to act as a co-factor with established bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Trueperella pyogenes to promote the development of endometritis and delay uterine repair mechanisms after calving. Both Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) are transmitted by insect vectors and lead to increased abortion rates and congenital malformations. BTV-8 also impairs the development of hatched blastocysts; furthermore, infection around the time of breeding with either virus appears to reduce conception rates. Although the reductions in conception rates are often difficult to quantify, they are nevertheless sufficient to cause economic losses, which help to justify the benefits of vaccination and eradication schemes.","ac93c3f7b9207fea7f888e2c53950c66e96b072f","True","Engineering","first|five|Bovine|BHV)-1|first|BHV-1|BHV-4|BHV-4|Escherichia|Trueperella|Schmallenberg|SBV|BTV|BTV-8","els-covid","","","","ORDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|ORDINAL|NORP|PRODUCT|LOC|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/j.eng.2019.07.020","custom_license"

Patients and Methods A retrospective analysis was performed among 48 consecutive patients undergoing HDC/ASCT with thiotepa, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide (TBC) conditioning for PCNSL (27 patients) or secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL)/CNS relapse (21 patients) between July 2006 and December 2017. Twenty-one of the patients with PCNSL underwent ASCT in CR1 Results The 2-year PFS rate was 80.5% (95% CI 69.9-92.9) and 2-year OS rate was 80.1% (95% CI 69.2-92.7) among all patients. The 2-year PFS and OS rate for PCNSL patients in CR1 was 95.2% (95% CI 86.6-100) and 95.2% (95% CI 86.6-100), respectively. In univariate analysis of PCNSL patients, ASCT in CR1 was the only variable noted to be significant for outcome (p = 0.007 for PFS; p = 0.008 for OS). Among patients with SCNSL/CNS relapse, the 2-year PFS and OS rate were comparable at 75.9% (95% CI 59.5-96.8) and 75.3% (95% CI 58.6-98.6), respectively. The most common side effects were febrile neutropenia (89.6%), of which 66.7% had an infectious etiology identified, nausea/vomiting (85.4%), diarrhea (93.8%), mucositis (89.6%), and electrolyte abnormalities (89.6%). Four patients (8.3%) experienced treatment-related mortality from overwhelming infection, of which 3 had SCNSL Conclusion High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant using TBC conditioning for both PCNSL and secondary CNS non-Hodgkin lymphoma appears to have encouraging long term efficacy with manageable side effects.","bdcac2bea32c1778c99e7e958f92c952774c3c94","True","Clinical Lymphoma Myeloma and Leukemia","HDC/ASCT|NHL|CNS|48|HDC|TBC|27|CNS|SCNSL)/CNS|21|between July 2006 and December 2017|Twenty-one|ASCT|2-year|80.5%|95%|CI|69.9-92.9|2-year|80.1%|95%|CI|69.2-92.7|2-year|PFS|OS|95.2%|95%|CI|86.6-100|95.2%|95%|CI|86.6-100|ASCT|0.007|PFS|0.008 for OS|2-year|PFS|OS|75.9%|95%|CI|59.5-96.8|75.3%|95%|CI|58.6-98.6|89.6%|66.7%|85.4%|93.8%|89.6%|89.6%|Four|8.3%|3|TBC","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|EVENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-20","","10.1016/j.clml.2020.02.009","custom_license"

In this study, the Large Eddy Simulation was utilized to predict the effects of thermal plume of different intensities on particle diffusion. Three postures of the human body model and three room temperatures were considered. The results show that the convective heat transfer coefficient on the surface of the human body varies greatly with different postures. The coefficient is the largest when the model is in sitting posture, leading to the greatest heat transfer rate. Meanwhile, the thermal plume generated by bending the thigh increases the size of the facial thermal plume in horizon direction. The increase of the difference between indoor temperature and skin temperature causes an increase of the convective heat transfer of the manikin, leading to stronger airflow in front of the face. The thicker and faster the human thermal plume is, the more difficult it is penetrated by aerosols produced by nasal breathing, finally resulting in most particles distributed within 0.2 m thick under the roof.","6a257f77d89acb56d4fdc789bec9e047f14c23ab","True","Sustainable Cities and Society","the Large Eddy Simulation|Three|three|0.2 m","els-covid","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.scs.2019.101935","custom_license"
"Chen, Toly","Assessing factors critical to smart technology applications to mobile health care − the fgm-fahp approach","Abstract Smart technologies present numerous opportunities for enhancing mobile health care. However, some concerns regarding the viability of smart technology applications must be addressed. This study investigated these concerns by reviewing the current practices of smart technology applications to mobile health care. As a result, five factors critical to the applicability of a smart technology to mobile health care are identified, and the fuzzy geometric mean-fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FGM-FAHP) approach is proposed to assess the relative importance levels of the identified factors. The experimental results showed that the three most critical factors identified include: (a) the relaxation of the related medical laws; (b) unobtrusiveness; and (c) the precise need and situation of a user. Accordingly, approximately 44%, 26%, and 15% of the budget should be allocated to the realization of the three critical factors, respectively. In addition, the challenges involved and opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of existing applications are discussed.","7236a1dfe6471dd707053f3a663074d3ddec004a","True","Health Policy and Technology","five|three|approximately 44%|26%|15%|three","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-02-15","","10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.02.005","custom_license"
"AlQahtany, Ali M.; Abubakar, Ismaila Rimi","Public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in a coastal metropolis of Saudi Arabia","Abstract Disaster risk reduction is an increasingly important policy issue, especially in developing countries that suffer most of the global human and economic losses associated with disasters. Indeed, public awareness and attitudes can help in disaster risk reduction and management efforts toward reducing mortality and economic losses. In Saudi Arabia, many cities have been recently experiencing incidences of disasters, such as floods, disease epidemics, and sandstorms. However, studies on public perception of disaster risk in the country are few and nascent. Therefore, based on a questionnaire survey (n = 683), this paper explores public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in Dammam, a coastal metropolis in Saudi Arabia. The findings indicate that although almost two-thirds (64.7%) of the participants are aware of disasters, and 81% are concerned about disaster risks, less than half (47.3%) believe that their settlements could be at risk. While 37% opine that disasters are caused by both natural factors and human activities, about half (54%) indicate that they can personally contribute to reducing disaster risks. Chi-square analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between place of residence and perception of disaster risks (χ2 (6) = 56.18, p < 0.05), and between place of residence and concern about disaster risks (χ2 (12) = 68.47, p < 0.05). The paper recommends raising public awareness and encouraging positive behaviors in reducing disaster risks in the study area and similar environments.","56ec24b06770347bc7dd532eb66c65f0cddc6f62","True","International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","Saudi Arabia|683|Dammam|Saudi Arabia|almost two-thirds|64.7%|81%|less than half|47.3%|37%|about half|54%|χ2|6|56.18|0.05|χ2|12|68.47|0.05","els-covid","","","","GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-04-30","","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101422","custom_license"
"Alwidyan, Mahmoud T.; Trainor, Joseph E.; Bissell, Richard A.","Responding to natural disasters vs. disease outbreaks: Do emergency medical service providers have different views?","Abstract Introduction Our planet has been experiencing a huge burden of natural disasters and public health emergencies in the last three decades. Emergency medical service providers are expected to be in the frontlines during such emergencies. Yet, this system is badly understudied when it comes to its roles and performance during disasters and public health emergencies. This study is designed to enhance understanding by assessing a sample U.S EMS providers’ views about working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks and explores whether they are coming to work during such conditions. Methods This study utilized a qualitative approach using face-to-face interviews with EMS workers from the State of Delaware, USA. Participants were asked about their views, insights, and potential behavior of working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks. Data collected were transcribed and coded using ATLAS.ti software to develop themes of the study using an inductive approach. Results Three themes were emerged from interviews regarding working during natural disasters; respondents expressed excitement, concern, or no real differences. For disease outbreaks, however, the two themes were concerned and no additional risk. While participants expressed varying concerns about working during disasters and pandemic conditions, everyone felt willing and obligated to come to work despite the perceived high risk for some of them to work in some conditions. Conclusion This study helps to provide the base upon which EMS, public health, and emergency management agencies can formulate actions that emerged from the views of EMS providers concerning work during disasters and public health emergencies.","c59be4a315ea75ba6f96045352a4ad746a0fa2fe","True","International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","the last three decades|U.S|EMS|EMS|the State of Delaware|USA|ATLAS.ti|Three|two|EMS|EMS","els-covid","","","","DATE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-04-30","","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101440","custom_license"

Long-acting muscarinic antagonists and β2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids inhibit the exacerbation of COPD and bronchial asthma caused by infection with viruses, including HCoV-229E. However, the effects of these drugs on HCoV-229E replication and infection-induced inflammation in the human airway are unknown. Methods Primary human nasal (HNE) and tracheal (HTE) epithelial cell cultures were infected with HCoV-229E. Results Pretreatment of HNE and HTE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol decreased viral RNA levels and/or titers, the expression of the HCoV-229E receptor CD13, the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes where HCoV-229E RNA enters the cytoplasm, and the infection-induced production of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-β. Treatment of the cells with the CD13 inhibitor 2′2′-dipyridyl decreased viral titers. Pretreatment of the cells with a combination of three drugs (glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide) exerted additive inhibitory effects on viral titers and cytokine production. Pretreatment of HNE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol reduced the susceptibility to infection, and pretreatment with the three drugs inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B p50 and p65 proteins. Pretreatment with formoterol increased cAMP levels and treatment with cAMP decreased viral titers, CD13 expression, and the fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes. Conclusions These findings suggest that glycopyrronium, formoterol, and a combination of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide inhibit HCoV-229E replication partly by inhibiting receptor expression and/or endosomal function and that these drugs modulate infection-induced inflammation in the airway.","5b0ccee8385f0a382fccfbf73f2bdc5518d4fcdb","True","Respiratory Investigation","229E|one|COPD|COPD|Methods Primary|HNE|HTE|HNE|HTE|RNA|CD13|IL-6|IL-8|CD13|2′2′-dipyridyl|three|HNE|three|CD13","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|LAW|ORG|LOC|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|FAC|PERSON|CARDINAL|LOC|CARDINAL|PRODUCT","Elsevier","2020-02-21","","10.1016/j.resinv.2019.12.005","custom_license"

Objective To study whether RSV or RV types are differentially associated with the future use of asthma control medication. Methods Over 2 consecutive winter seasons (2008-2010), we enrolled 408 children hospitalized for bronchiolitis at age less than 24 months into a prospective, 3-center, 4-year follow-up study in Finland. Virus detection was performed by real-time reverse transcription PCR from nasal wash samples. Four years later, we examined current use of asthma control medication. Results A total of 349 (86%) children completed the 4-year follow-up. At study entry, the median age was 7.5 months, and 42% had RSV, 29% RV, 2% both RSV and RV, and 27% non-RSV/-RV etiology. The children with RV-A (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.3; P = .01), RV-C (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.5; P < .001), and non-RSV/-RV (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.0; P = .004) bronchiolitis started the asthma control medication earlier than did children with RSV bronchiolitis. Four years later, 27% of patients used asthma control medication; both RV-A (adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; P = .03) and RV-C (adjusted odds ratio, 3.7; P < .001) etiology were associated with the current use of asthma medication. The highest risk was found among patients with RV-C, atopic dermatitis, and fever (adjusted odds ratio, 5.0; P = .03). Conclusions Severe bronchiolitis caused by RV-A and RV-C was associated with earlier initiation and prolonged use of asthma control medication.

Assessing the effect of interventions on childhood pneumonia is challenging because the choice of case definition and surveillance approach can affect the identification of pneumonia substantially. In anticipation of an intervention trial aimed to reduce childhood pneumonia by lowering household air pollution, we created a working group to provide recommendations regarding study design and implementation. We suggest to, first, select a standard case definition that combines acute (≤14 days) respiratory symptoms and signs and general danger signs with ancillary tests (such as chest imaging and pulse oximetry) to improve pneumonia identification; second, to prioritise active hospital-based pneumonia surveillance over passive case finding or home-based surveillance to reduce the risk of non-differential misclassification of pneumonia and, as a result, a reduced effect size in a randomised trial; and, lastly, to consider longitudinal follow-up of children younger than 1 year, as this age group has the highest incidence of severe pneumonia.","7fadc31f532d97c2f2317c05237e5d17833a0381","True","The Lancet Respiratory Medicine","Summary Pneumonia|younger than 5 years|the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses|first|≤14 days|second|younger than 1 year","els-covid","","","31591066","PERSON|DATE|ORG|ORDINAL|DATE|ORDINAL|DATE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/S2213-2600(19)30249-8","custom_license"
"Kurup, Karishma K.; John, Denny; Ponnaiah, Manickam; George, Tijo","Use of systematic epidemiological methods in outbreak investigations from India, 2008–2016: A systematic review","Abstract Background In the absence of a comprehensive review, we conducted a systematic review on the use of systematic approach in outbreak investigation using reports from India. Objectives The primary objective was to estimate the proportion of outbreak reports from India during 2008–16, that reported the steps in outbreak investigation. The secondary objectives were to (1) describe the outbreak reports by selected characteristics (source, investigating agency, disease, time, place and person) (2) estimate the proportion of outbreaks that conducted analytical and additional studies. Methods We searched eight electronic databases and grey literature for outbreak investigation reports among humans at community settings from India during 2008–2016. We developed a check-list based on the 10-steps approach used by Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP) of ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology (ICMR-NIE), Chennai, India. This checklist was used to independently screen and extract data on general characteristics of the outbreak investigation reports and the steps completed. We adopted The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) check list for prevalence studies to examine the credibility and consistency. The protocol was registered at Prospero (CRD42017065038). We calculated proportion of reports that followed the steps in their investigation and descriptive statistics on selected characteristics. Results Of 10,657 articles screened, 136 articles were included for the review. Completion of the ten steps in the outbreak investigations was seen in 16% of reports.

"Gale, Paul","How virus size and attachment parameters affect the temperature sensitivity of virus binding to host cells: Predictions of a thermodynamic model for arboviruses and HIV","Abstract Virus binding to host cells involves specific interactions between viral (glyco)proteins (GP) and host cell surface receptors (Cr) (protein or sialic acid (SA)). The magnitude of the enthalpy of association changes with temperature according to the change in heat capacity (ΔCp) on GP/Cr binding, being little affected for avian influenza virus (AIV) haemagglutinin (HA) binding to SA (ΔCp = 0 kJ/mol/K) but greatly affected for HIV gp120 binding to CD4 receptor (ΔCp = -5.0 kJ/mol/K). A thermodynamic model developed here predicts that values of ΔCp from 0 to ∼-2.0 kJ/mol/K have relatively little impact on the temperature sensitivity of the number of mosquito midgut cells with bound arbovirus, while intermediate values of ΔCp of ∼-3.0 kJ/mol/K give a peak binding at a temperature of ∼20°C as observed experimentally for Western equine encephalitis virus. More negative values of ΔCp greatly decrease arbovirus binding at temperatures below ∼20°C. Thus to promote transmission at low temperatures, arboviruses may benefit from ΔCp ∼ 0 kJ/mol/K as for HA/SA and it is interesting that bluetongue virus binds to SA in midge midguts. Large negative values of ΔCp as for HIV gp120:CD4 diminish binding at 37°C. Of greater importance, however, is the decrease in entropy of the whole virus (ΔSa_immob) on its immobilisation on the host cell surface. ΔSa_immob presents a repulsive force which the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions weakened at higher temperatures struggle to overcome. ΔSa_immob is more negative (less favourable) for larger diameter viruses which therefore show diminished binding at higher temperatures than smaller viruses. It is proposed that small size phenotype through a less negative ΔSa_immob is selected for viruses infecting warmer hosts thus explaining the observation that virion volume decreases with increasing host temperature from 0°C to 40°C in the case of dsDNA viruses. Compared to arboviruses which also infect warm-blooded vertebrates, HIV is large at 134 nm diameter and thus would have a large negative ΔSa_immob which would diminish its binding at human body temperature. It is proposed that prior non-specific binding of HIV through attachment factors takes much of the entropy loss for ΔSa_immob so enhancing subsequent specific gp120:CD4 binding at 37°C. This is consistent with the observation that HIV attachment factors are not essential but augment infection. Antiviral therapies should focus on increasing virion size, for example through binding of zinc oxide nanoparticles to herpes simplex virus, hence making ΔSa_immob more negative, and thus reducing binding affinity at 37°C.","c11f57c9a4144cc1ccd87114a549da0d1c0ca6ae","True","Microbial Risk Analysis","glyco)proteins|GP|Cr|SA|GP/Cr|AIV|SA|kJ/mol|kJ|∼-3.0|kJ|∼20|∼20|∼ 0|HA/SA|SA|37|GP/Cr|134|37|37","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|LOC|GPE|LOC|NORP|NORP|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-12","","10.1016/j.mran.2020.100104","custom_license"

In addition, the system was also designed to deal with the variability in age and gender, which would affect the accuracy of the detection. Furthermore, to enable a low-cost, non-contact and embedded system, multiple vital signs from a medical radar were measured and all algorithms were implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array, named PYNQ-Z1. Methods The system consisted of two main stages: digital signal processing and data classification. In the former stage, Butterworth filters, with flexible cut-off frequencies depending on age and gender, and a time-domain peak detection algorithm were deployed to compute three vital signs, namely heart rate, respiratory rate, and standard deviation of heart beat-to-beat interval. For the classification problem, two machine learning models, Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, were implemented. Results The Student's t-test showed that our proposed digital signal processing algorithms coped well with the variability of human cases in age and gender. Meanwhile, the f1-score of roughly 98.0% represented the high sensitivity and specificity of our proposed machine learning methods. Conclusion This study outlines the implementation of an infection screening system, which achieved competent performance. The system might be beneficial for fast screening of infected patients at public health centers in underdeveloped areas, where people have little access to healthcare.","780f1e8693bb6f32fd116970fee4a4887fb0ffc8","True","Informatics in Medicine Unlocked","a Field Programmable Gate Array|PYNQ|two|Butterworth|three|two|Support Vector Machine|Quadratic Discriminant Analysis|Student|roughly 98.0%","els-covid","","","","FAC|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.imu.2019.100225","custom_license"

This retrospective study examined the fecal tests records from 1111 dogs and 203 cats with diarrhea submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in the city of Medellin between January and May 2018. The detection of parasites was carried out by direct smears and simple flotation methods. Parasitic organisms were detected in feces from 464 (41.7%) dogs and 96 (47.3%) cats. In order of decreasing prevalence, the parasites detected in dogs were: Giardia intestinalis (13%), ancylostomids (12.6%), Entamoeba spp. (6.1%), coccidian oocysts (5.8%), Toxocara spp. (5.6%) and Dipylidium caninum (1.3%). In cats, the prevalence was: Giardia intestinalis (20%), coccidian oocysts (8.9%), Entamoeba spp. (7.9%), ancylostomids (6.4%), Toxocara spp. (2.5%) and Dipylidium caninum (2%). Age, but not gender, was a predisposing factor, as puppies and kittens had significantly higher infection rates that older age categories. The majority of Giardia intestinalis positive cases occurred in puppies (109/145, 75.2%) and kittens (19/36, 52.8%), making this parasite the most prevalent in amongst animals with diarrhea. Out of 117 positive infections in the adult dog population, ancylostomids accounted for 56 cases (47.9%) and was the most common parasite in this age group. In conclusion, although these results do not imply a cause and effect relationship, they are an estimate of the type of parasites that may be most commonly associated with diarrhea in dogs and cats. The lower diagnostic sensitivity of the traditional methods used here as compared to more contemporary techniques like fecal flotation with centrifugation and PCR, may have underestimated the actual prevalence and diminished the detection of co-infections. Future studies should aim to have diagnostic panels that also screen for other enteric pathogens, including bacterial and viral agents.","af19f14e780e9e8da5b0aab3854749a3608a4192","True","Veterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports","1111|203|Medellin|between January|May 2018|464|41.7%|96|47.3%|Giardia|13%|12.6%|Entamoeba|6.1%|5.8%|Toxocara|5.6%|Dipylidium|1.3%|Giardia|20%|8.9%|Entamoeba|7.9%|6.4%|Toxocara|2.5%|Dipylidium|2%|Giardia|109/145|75.2%|19/36|52.8%|117|56|47.9%","els-covid","","","31796191","ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.100335","custom_license"
"Mammeri, Mohamed; Chevillot, Aurélie; Chenafi, Ilham; Thomas, Myriam; Julien, Christine; Vallée, Isabelle; Polack, Bruno; Follet, Jérôme; Adjou, Karim Tarik","Molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium isolates from diarrheal dairy calves in France","Abstract Cryptosporidium is an obligate intracellular protist parasite infecting a wide range of vertebrate hosts and causes significant intestinal disease in both animals and humans, as some species are zoonotic. Cattle and especially calves have been identified as one of the most common reservoirs of this protist. However, little is known about the genetics of Cryptosporidium in calves in some regions of France. The aim of this study was to detect and isolate Cryptosporidium spp. in faecal samples from naturally infected pre-weaned calves (≤45 days-old) in France. A total of 35 diarrhoeic pre-weaned calf faecal samples were collected from 26 dairy cattle farms in six departments (French administrative provinces). Cryptosporidium presence was established by microscopically screening samples for oocystes with an immunofluorescent (DFA) staining method. DFA-positive samples were then analysed by PCR-RFLP and 18S rRNA gene sequencing to determine species. Cryptosporidium parvum-positive samples were subtyped via nested PCR analysis of a partial fragment of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene product. Data were then integrated into phylogenetic tree analysis. DFA revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in 31 out of 35 (88%) samples. Combined with 18S rRNA gene analysis results, C. parvum was detected in 30 samples. Subtyping analysis in 27/30 samples (90%) of the C. parvum isolates revealed two zoonotic subtype families, IIa (24/27) and IId (3/27). Four subtypes were recognised within the subtype family IIa, including the hypertransmissible IIaA15G2R1 subtype that is the most frequently reported worldwide (21/27), IIaA17G3R1 (1/27), IIaA17G1R1 (1/27), and IIaA19G1R1 (1/27). Two subtypes were recognised within the IId subtype family including IIdA22G1 (2/27) and IIdA27G1 (1/27). These findings illustrate the high occurrence of Cryptosporidium in calves in dairy herds and increase the diversity of molecularly characterised C. parvum isolates with the first description of IIaA17G3R1, IIaA19G1R1, and IId subtypes in France. The presence of zoonotic C. parvum subtype families (IIa, IId) in this study suggests that pre-weaned calves are likely to be a significant reservoir of zoonotic C. parvum, and highlights the importance of animal to human cryptosporidiosis transmission risk. Further molecular studies in calves and small ruminants from other French regions are required to better understand the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in France.","42ed4c4f257b2c9776eacccb1fc093132df5f94a","True","Veterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports","Cryptosporidium|France|Cryptosporidium|days-old|France|35|26|six|French|PCR-RFLP|Cryptosporidium|60|Cryptosporidium|31|35|88%|C.|30|27/30|90%|C.|two|24/27|3/27|Four|IIaA15G2R1|21/27|IIaA17G3R1|1/27|IIaA17G1R1|1/27|IIaA19G1R1|1/27|Two|IIdA22G1 (2/27|Cryptosporidium|C.|first|IIaA17G3R1|IIaA19G1R1|France|C.|C.|French|France","els-covid","","","31796198","ORG|GPE|ORG|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|FAC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|GPE|NORP|GPE|ORG|ORG|NORP|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.100323","custom_license"

The present case report describes an 11-month-old male neutered European short hair cat which presented with generalised subcutaneous oedema and pleural and peritoneal effusions. According to clinical examination, abdominal imaging and laboratory analyses, a tentative diagnosis of severe glomerulopathy with massive proteinuria was made. Due to worsening of the clinical signs despite therapeutic interventions and a poor prognosis, the cat was euthanised. Necropsy and histological examinations revealed severe bilateral collagenofibrotic glomerulopathy, generalised oedema and a focal verminous pneumonia with thrombosis in arterial lung vessels containing nematode cross sections. A serum sample was tested for the presence of antibodies against the cat lungworm A. abstrusus, resulting negative. Genetic analyses confirmed the presence of nematode DNA; after exclusion of common lung and heart parasites occurring in cats, DNA of the canid heart worm nematode Angiostrongylus vasorum was identified. This is the first description of a naturally occurring infection with A. vasorum in a cat. Previous experimental studies demonstrated the development of adult male and female A. vasorum worms containing eggs in cats, but no larval excretion in the faeces. Although cats did not become patent, A. vasorum infections were clinically relevant. As A. abstrusus and A. vasorum are both gastropod transmitted nematodes, they may share the same intermediate hosts within overlapping areas. In addition, especially chronic A. abstrusus infected cats become non-patent and do not excrete L1. Considering that patent A. vasorum infections are widespread in the dog and fox population in Switzerland (and several other countries) but are apparently not patent in cats, we cannot exclude that infections with A. vasorum may occur more frequently than expected.","bdd13ea60530025779ed7758e83c6b57f4a84c96","True","Veterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports","Cardiopulmonary|feline|11-month-old|European|Necropsy|A.|first|A.|A.|A.|A.|A.|A.|A.|Switzerland|A.","els-covid","","","31796174","ORG|DATE|DATE|NORP|PERSON|PERSON|ORDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|GPE|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.100342","custom_license"

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study on 7.347 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as the principal diagnosis, using hospitalization discharge summary data from January 1 to December 31, 2015. Disease stages were classified as stages 1, 2, and 3. Results Of 7.347 patients, 16.2% had urinary tract infections. The urinary tract infection prevalence was 24.4% in 428 patients in stage 1 and 4.8% in 2.840 patients in stage 2; it was higher among patients who underwent medical procedures than among those who underwent surgery (24.4% vs 4.8%).

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection caused more than half of the deaths due to cirrhosis in the region, followed by alcohol consumption (20·8%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; 12·1%), and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV; 15·7%). In 2015, HBV accounted for about half the cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the region. Preventive strategies for viral hepatitis-related liver disease include increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation. HBV vaccination programmes for neonates have been implemented by all countries, although birth-dose coverage is extremely suboptimal in some. Availability of screening tests for blood and tissue, donor recall policies, and harm reduction strategies are in their initial stages in most countries. Many governments have put HBV and HCV drugs on their essential medicines lists and the availability of generic versions of these drugs has reduced costs. Efforts to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat, together with the rapid increase in per-capita alcohol consumption in countries and the epidemic of obesity, are expected to change the spectrum of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region in the near future. The increasing burden of alcohol-related liver diseases can be contained through government policies to limit consumption and promote less harmful patterns of alcohol use, which are in place in some countries but need to be enforced more strictly. Steps are needed to control obesity and NAFLD, including policies to promote healthy lifestyles and regulate the food industry. Inadequate infrastructure and insufficient health-care personnel trained in liver diseases are issues that also need to be addressed in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy response of most governments to liver diseases has thus far been inadequate and poorly funded. There must be a renewed focus on prevention, early detection, timely referral, and research into the best means to introduce and improve health interventions to reduce the burden of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region.","9d1fc6c858dfe028aef86221cf3567f8824c2f0e","True","The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology","Summary|Asia-Pacific region|more than half|62·6%|2015|54·3%|72·7%|more than two-thirds|2015|Chronic|more than half|20·8%|NAFLD|12·1%|HCV|15·7%|2015|HBV|about half|HBV|HCV|the Asia-Pacific region|NAFLD|the Asia-Pacific region|the Asia-Pacific region","els-covid","","","31852635","GPE|LOC|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|LOC|ORG|LOC|LOC","Elsevier","2020-02-29","","10.1016/S2468-1253(19)30342-5","custom_license"

A total of 162 fecal samples were cultivated for E. coli. Samples were also subcultivated to detect E. coli with extended-spectrum ß-lactamases (ESBLs). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed by disk diffusion using a panel of 16 antimicrobials. In addition, isolates were screened for the presence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance genes mcr-1 to mcr-5. Samples from 20 (12.4%) of the camels contained antimicrobial resistant (AMR) E. coli, and 85% of the AMR isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). The highest frequency of resistance was observed to tetracycline (11.7%), followed by ampicillin and streptomycin (both 10.5%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (9.9%). Two (1.2%) of the isolates showed intermediate resistance to cefazolin and streptomycin, respectively. All the isolates were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, aztreonam and kanamycin, and 86.4% of the isolates were susceptible to all 16 antimicrobials used in this study. The prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL producing E. coli was 0.6%. PCR and amplicon sequencing showed that the ESBL producer belonged to E. coli phylogenetic group A, sequence type (ST) 48, and harbored bla CTX-M-15. None of the isolates contained mcr genes. The results indicate that dromedary camels in Kenya may be reservoirs of AMR E. coli, including ESBL producers, that could potentially be transmitted to humans by direct contact or via the food chain.","93d4534eecee1fe4ccfb36ea1449d53323127a9c","True","Scientific African","Escherichia|Kenya|162|AST|16|mcr-1|20|12.4%|AMR|85%|AMR|MDR|11.7%|10.5%|9.9%|Two|1.2%|86.4%|16|ESBL|0.6%|ESBL|48|CTX-M-15|Kenya|AMR E. coli|ESBL","els-covid","","","","GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|GPE|PERSON|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e00274","custom_license"

Schiff base ligands are considered as privileged ligands as they are simply synthesized by condensation. They show broad range of application in medicine, pharmacy, coordination chemistry, biological activities, industries, food packages, dyes, and polymer and also used as an O2 detector. Semicarbazone is an imine derivative which is derived from condensation of semicarbazide and suitable aldehyde and ketone. Imine ligand–containing transition metal complexes such as copper, zinc, and cadmium have shown to be excellent precursors for synthesis of metal or metal chalcogenide nanoparticles. In recent years, the researchers have attracted enormous attention toward Schiff bases, semicarbazones, thiosemicarbazones, and their metal complexes owing to numerous applications in pharmacology such as antiviral, antifungal, antimicrobial, antimalarial, antituberculosis, anticancer, anti-HIV, catalytic application in oxidation of organic compounds, and nanotechnology. In this review, we summarize the synthesis, structural, biological, and catalytic application of Schiff bases as well as their metal complexes.","f114b50d9c6927b687919b004d82317fd4def6cc","True","Materials Today Chemistry","Schiff|Schiff|recent years|Schiff|Schiff","els-covid","","","","PERSON|PERSON|DATE|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.mtchem.2019.100195","custom_license"

Anaerobic digestion can only reduce the sludge volume by 50% in mass, leaving the other half as a growing waste management and hygienic problem. Hydrothermal Processing (HTP), a set of several chemical digestion processes, could be employed to convert sewage sludge into valuable products and minimize potential environmental pollution risks. Specifically, hydrothermal carbonization and hydrothermal liquefaction have been extensively studied to sustainably manage sludge. Two of the main reasons for this are the high upscaleability of HTP for public waste management and that it is estimated that HTP can recover eleven times more energy from waste products than landfilling. An integration of HTP with anaerobic digestion or recycling the soluble organics (in the HTP aqueous products) into the HTP process could lead to a higher overall rate of energy recovery for municipal sewage sludge.","f033dc06606b56ba51fbc3e4293372bf2428e27a","True","Current Opinion in Environmental Science & Health","US|annually|79 million dry tons|50%|the other half|Hydrothermal Processing|HTP|Two|HTP|HTP|eleven|HTP|HTP|HTP","els-covid","","","","GPE|DATE|QUANTITY|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-10","","10.1016/j.coesh.2020.02.008","custom_license"

Emergency department (ED) clinicians are at high risk of exposure to both these and common communicable diseases. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended to protect clinicians from acquiring, or becoming vectors of, infection, yet compliance is typically sub-optimal. Little is known about factors that influence use of PPE—specifically gloves and masks—during routine care in the ED. Methods This was an ethnographic study, incorporating documentation review, field observations and interviews. The theoretical domains framework (TDF) was used to aid thematic analysis and identify relevant enablers of and barriers to optimal PPE use. Results Thirty-one behavioural themes were identified that influenced participants’ use of masks and gloves. There were significant differences, namely: more reported enablers of glove use vs more barriers to mask use. Reasons included more positive unit culture towards glove use, and lower perception of risk via facial contamination. Conclusion Emerging infectious diseases, spread (among other routes) by respiratory droplets, have caused global outbreaks. Emergency clinicians should ensure that, as with gloves, the use of masks is incorporated into routine cares where appropriate. Further research which examines items of PPE independently is warranted.","9dc34862d293de4b2fc5d07d28362045d71f51a6","True","Australasian Emergency Care","PPE|PPE|ED|PPE|Thirty-one|participants’|PPE","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-04","","10.1016/j.auec.2019.10.002","custom_license"

The harmonized management of biological risks in such diverse laboratories thus appears as a real challenge. Zhejiang Province in China has taken the initiative to establish a comprehensively integrated laboratory biosafety management system called SINS (Standardization, Informatization, Normalization and Systematization). The SINS model system has been introduced and adopted in 1,721 BSL-2 laboratories in Zhejiang Province, and thus lead to an increase in the number of biosafety committees from 20% to more than 95% from 2007 to 2018, and the number of biosafety laboratory managers who knows biosafety-related laws and regulations increase from 52.7% to 83.7% from 2009 to 2017. Such achievements indicate that the successful implementation of SINS model has increased the effective control of biological risks in BSL-2 laboratories of the Zhejiang Province. SINS model and its main effects on leading the improvement of laboratory biosafety management was presented in this review. The SINS model helps to strengthen laboratory biosafety and thus effectively reduces occurrence of biosafety-related incidences. This model can potentially be used by other regions or countries where harmonized biosafety management system is still under-developing.","be4cd88f0c458769a253ef97c5643ad4562bf48e","True","Biosafety and Health","2|pathogenic|Zhejiang Province|China|SINS (Standardization, Informatization, Normalization and Systematization|SINS|1,721|BSL-2|Zhejiang Province|20%|more than 95%|2007|2018|52.7%|83.7%|2009|2017|SINS|BSL-2|the Zhejiang Province","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|ORG|PRODUCT|GPE","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.bsheal.2019.12.004","custom_license"

Therefore, a rapid, sensitive, and specific serologic test for detecting anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in both humans and animals is urgently needed for the successful management of this illness. Here, we evaluated various novel luciferase immunosorbent assays (LISA) based on nucleocapsid protein (NP) as well as fragments derived from spike protein (S) including subunit 1 (S1), N terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD) and subunit 2 (S2) of S for the detection of MERS-CoV-specific IgG. Fusion proteins, including nanoluciferase (NLuc) and various fragments derived from the NP or S protein of MERS-CoV, were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells. LISAs that detected anti-MERS-CoV IgG were further developed using cell lysates expressing various fusion proteins. Panels of human or animal samples infected with MERS-CoV were used to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of various LISAs in reference to a MERS-CoV RT-PCR, commercial S1-based ELISA, and pseudovirus particle neutralization test (ppNT). Our results showed that the S1-, RBD-, and NP-LISAs were more sensitive than the NTD- and S2-LISAs for the detection of anti-MERS-CoV IgG. Furthermore, the S1-, RBD-, and NP-LISAs were more sensitive (by at least 16-fold) than the commercially available S1-ELISA. Moreover, the S1-, RBD-, and NP-LISA specifically recognized anti-MERS-CoV IgG and did not cross-react with samples derived from other human CoV (OC43, 229E, HKU1, NL63)-infected patients. More importantly, these LISAs proved their applicability and reliability for detecting anti-MERS-CoV IgG in samples from camels, monkeys, and mice, among which the RBD-LISA exhibited excellent performance. The results of this study suggest that the novel MERS-CoV RBD- and S1- LISAs are highly effective platforms for the rapid and sensitive detection of anti-MERS-CoV IgG in human and animal samples. These assays have the potential to be used as serologic tests for the management and control of MERS-CoV infection.","41e058c88e4a85497c84cec7b3e34bc0aeeaccae","True","Biosafety and Health","Middle East|CoV|CoV|LISA|NP|1|S1|NTD|RBD|2|IgG.

If the source of infection can be effectively controlled in the early stages of an outbreak, the spread of infectious diseases can be prevented. In view of this situation, this study developed for infectious or suspected infectious patients a negative pressure isolation hood which effectively achieves direct individual isolation during the early stages of disease outbreak, and facilitates long-distance transport. The hood body is made of flexible transparent polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material, and the combination of the hood material is airtight. The unique inflatable column support structure and the design of the inflatable neck sleeve effectively ensure both stiffness and air tightness of the hood body. The electrical exhaust system maintains a stable negative pressure environment inside the hood, and polluted air inside the hood can be purified by a high efficiency filter. Test results showed that the internal noise of the hood was 68 ± 1 dB (A), the air exhaust volume of the electric exhaust system was not <200 L/min, and the filtration efficiency of the filter to 0.3 μm particles was >99.99%, indicating that the hood achieved effective isolation protection for patients with respiration infectious diseases.","4c71c09b219d9e4dbc1eabae14aade60c5d4cd3d","True","Biosafety and Health","68|200|L/min|0.3|99.99%","els-covid","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.bsheal.2019.12.007","custom_license"

Bronchoscopy with targeted bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is often used in AHSCT patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) to help guide management. Aim To evaluate how positive BAL results change antimicrobial management of AHSCT recipients with suspected LRTI. Methods We performed a retrospective review of BAL results from January 2014 to July 2016 for 54 AHSCT recipients. A positive BAL was determined by culture, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (AGA), and cytology. Findings BAL was positive for infectious etiologies in 63%, and antimicrobials were adjusted in 48/54 (89%) of patients. Antibacterial escalation was predicted by a positive BAL bacterial culture (OR 7.61, P=0.017). Antibiotic de-escalation was more likely with an elevated AGA (OR 3.86, P=0.035). Antiviral initiation was more likely with positive BAL multiplex PCR (OR 17.33, P=0.010). Antifungals were more likely to be escalated or changed with an elevated AGA (OR 4.33, P=0.020). The patients with a negative BAL were more likely to be started on steroids (OR 0.19, P= 0.043). Conclusions BAL was helpful to determine the etiology of pulmonary complications and optimize antimicrobials. The addition of AGA and multiplex PCR to standard BAL significantly impacted de-escalating antibiotics and adjusting antifungals to provide adequate coverage. The association with an elevated AGA with antibacterial de-escalation highlights a new role for BAL in antimicrobial optimization.","af7f9850a6dafa3f4922d4a3b02adafa55869959","True","Infection Prevention in Practice","Pulmonary|AHSCT|BAL|AHSCT|LRTI|BAL|AHSCT|LRTI|BAL|January 2014 to July 2016|54|AHSCT|BAL|Aspergillus|AGA|Findings BAL|63%|48/54|89%|BAL|Antibiotic de-escalation|AGA|3.86|BAL|17.33|AGA|4.33|BAL|0.19|Conclusions BAL|AGA|BAL|AGA|BAL","els-covid","","","","GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERSON|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.infpip.2019.100029","custom_license"

Patients and methods We prospectively included all adult and pediatric patients admitted to Necker hospital (Paris) between October 2018 and February 2019 with a diagnosis of RSV-associated ALRI. We compared characteristics of ALRIs between patients with community-acquired versus nosocomial infections and, in each group, between children and adults. Results Community-acquired and nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs were diagnosed in 229 and 11 inpatients, respectively. The burden of community-acquired infections was higher in children than in adults: 2.1% versus 0.2% of the total number of pediatric and adult inpatients, respectively (p < 0.0001); 4.2% versus 0.2% of the total number of hospitalization days in pediatric and adult units, respectively (p < 0.0001). Compared to inpatients with community-acquired ALRIs, those with nosocomial infections were more frequently adults (45.5% versus 2.6%, p = 0.0005) and subjects with at least one chronic complex condition (100.0% versus 41.0%, p < 0.0001). The total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial ALRIs was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p < 0.0001). Conclusions Nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs rarely occurred, suggesting a good effectiveness of our infection control strategy. However, the burden of nosocomial infection was higher in adults than in children, suggesting that education and training of healthcare personnel, patients and visitors about the risk of nosocomial RSV infections should be reinforced in adult wards.","f738928dba37be9b02edcdaf480cc8c653614585","True","Infection Prevention in Practice","Summary Objective|ALRIs|French|tertiary|Necker|Paris|between October 2018 and February 2019|RSV|ALRI|ALRIs|RSV|ALRIs|229|11|2.1%|0.2%|0.0001|4.2%|0.2%|hospitalization days|0.0001|ALRIs|45.5%|2.6%|0.0005|100.0%|41.0%|0.0001|ALRIs|0.32%|0.11%|0.0001|ALRIs|RSV","els-covid","","","","ORG|ORG|NORP|ORDINAL|PERSON|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|PERSON|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-06-30","","10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100041","custom_license"

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. EXPOSURES: Documented NCIP. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. RESULTS: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.","","False","JAMA","December 2019|Wuhan|China|NCIP|138|Zhongnan Hospital|Wuhan University|Wuhan|China|January 1 to January 28, 2020|February 3, 2020|MAIN OUTCOMES|138|56 years|42-68|22-92 years|75|54.3%|40|29%|17|12.3%|136|98.6%|96|69.6%|82|59.4%|Lymphopenia|0.8 × 109/L|0.6-1.1|97|70.3%|13.0 seconds|12.3-13.7|80|58%|261|U/L|182|55|39.9%|Chest|124|89.9%|89|64.4%|34|24.6%|25|18.1%|62|44.9%|Thirty-six|26.1%|ICU|22|61.1%|16|44.4%|11|30.6%|first|5.0 days|7.0 days|ARDS|8.0 days|36|ICU|102|66 years vs 51 years|26|72.2%|38|37.3%|23|63.9%|20|19.6%|24|66.7%|31|30.4%|36|ICU|4|11.1%|15 (41.7%|17|47.2%|4|February 3|47|34.1%|6|4.3%|47|10 days|7.0-14.0|138|Wuhan|China|2019-nCoV|41%|26%|4.3%","unk","#537","","32031570","DATE|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|FAC|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|TIME|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT","WHO","2020-03-17","3005079553","10.1001/jama.2020.1585",""

Given the continual spread of COVID-19 around the world, understanding the action items that were implemented quickly in Taiwan and assessing the effectiveness of these actions in preventing a large-scale epidemic may be instructive for other countries. COVID-19 occurred just before the Lunar New Year during which time millions of Chinese and Taiwanese were expected to travel for the holidays. Taiwan quickly mobilized and instituted specific approaches for case identification, containment, and resource allocation to protect the public health. Taiwan leveraged its national health insurance database and integrated it with its immigration and customs database to begin the creation of big data for analytics; it generated real-time alerts during a clinical visit based on travel history and clinical symptoms to aid case identification. It also used new technology, including QR code scanning and online reporting of travel history and health symptoms to classify travelers’ infectious risks based on flight origin and travel history in the past 14 days. Persons with low risk (no travel to level 3 alert areas) were sent a health declaration border pass via SMS (short message service) messaging to their phones for faster immigration clearance; those with higher risk (recent travel to level 3 alert areas) were quarantined at home and tracked through their mobile phone to ensure that they remained at home during the incubation period. Moreover, Taiwan enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms (based on information from the National Health Insurance [NHI] database) who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19; 1 was found of 113 cases. The toll-free number 1922 served as a hotline for citizens to report suspicious symptoms or cases in themselves or others; as the disease progressed, this hotline has reached full capacity, so each major city was asked to create its own hotline as an alternative. It is not known how often this hotline has been used. The government addressed the issue of disease stigma and compassion for those affected by providing food, frequent health checks, and encouragement for those under quarantine. This rapid response included hundreds of action items (eTable in the Supplement).","","False","JAMA","Taiwan|81 miles|China|second|2019|COVID-19|23 million|850|404 000|China.2,3|2019|2.71 million|Taiwan|China|2003|COVID-19|Taiwan|the Lunar New Year|millions|Chinese|Taiwanese|Taiwan|Taiwan|QR|the past 14 days|3|3|Taiwan|the National Health Insurance|COVID-19|1|113|1922|hundreds","unk","#3284","","32125371","GPE|QUANTITY|GPE|ORDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|EVENT|CARDINAL|NORP|NORP|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL","WHO","2020-03-03","2157954477","10.1001/jama.2020.3151",""

Risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well delineated. Objective To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 13, 2020. Exposures Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Main Outcomes and Measures The development of ARDS and death. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed. Results Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS, and of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died. In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]). In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever (≥39 °C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72).

"Tárnok, Attila","Machine Learning, COVID-19 (2019-nCoV), and multi-OMICS","The primary plan of my editorial for this month was to highlight and comment on the special issue of this month: “Machine Learning for Single Cell Data”. I wish to emphasize and thank the Guest Editors of this special issue, Yvan Saeys and Greg Finak, for their outstanding success and hard work to assemble excellent manuscripts for this issue. I am referring to their guest editorial giving you more details on aims and scopes and elaborating on specific articles. I started drafting this editorial while attending the annual Photonics West conference in San Francisco, presumably the largest showcase on photonics technologies and instrumentation. Scientifically, the sub‐conference BIOS demonstrated the broadness and vividness of photonics technologies in life sciences and particularly in single cell analysis. When searching for relevant literature for this editorial, I was also tracking the actual global developments. This brought me to change my focus and comment on some issues that are relevant to our field and somewhat related to that of the special issue. First of all, Nature Methods announced their Method of the Year 2019 1. It is: “Single‐cell multimodal omics” and acknowledges (among others) the important contribution of highly multiplexed flow cytometry and cell sorting to the increased understanding of single cell biology and cell systems. This is motivating and confirms that cytometry is receiving the focus of attention. Concurrently, in the last weeks the relevance of the recent COVID‐19 (2019‐nCoV) outbreak and its effects started to become evident as everybody was monitoring the number of cases registered globally 2. As conference chairs, we were facing the fact that many of our speakers and colleagues became unavailable. Not only that, but the eeriness of the infection (it is transmissible already during its asymptomatic latency period of up to two weeks, recent results indicate even longer) gave many attendees an uneasy feeling. This brings me to two points worth discussing. (a) Are large scale conferences with global attendance still state of the art or should they be rethought; and (b) to what extent can cytometry support global efforts in various fields of epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases? In the past one to two decades the world faced several outbreaks of different viral infections that were luckily not as disastrous as initially anticipated but still claimed victims. These were coronaviruses such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) in 2002/2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) with occasional outbreaks since 2012 or influenza viruses like the H1N1 pandemic in 2009/2010. It is only a matter of time until other pandemics follow. Global travel for work and leisure supports viral spread and can transport the infection to nearly all places of the globe within days. Global conferences contribute to such a rapid spread and one should reconsider this model of scientific exchange from time to time and scrutinize potential alternatives. Models for sustainable international conferences are under testing and combine venues in close proximity to institutions with a substantial expertise on the focus area of the conference with virtual participation and contribution by internet for participants on more distant places. Although personal meetings are essential for optimal information exchange, a reduction in travel would not only reduce the risk of dissemination of disease but, as a side effect, could result in budgetary savings, reduce travel‐related emissions (in the wake of Greta), and eliminate jetlag. Now, what can Cytometry do for help in pandemics? Cytometry has already supported several achievements as a quick and non‐representative literature search shows. Image cytometry methods 3 and bead‐based flow cytometry methods 4 are at hand to enable for screening and detecting antibody virus interactions and detect viral antigens. Airway memory T‐cells and viral E protein mutations have been identified in CoV infections a potential targets for vaccine strategies 5, 6. Immune responses seem to be indicative of disease severity 6, 7 but more studies are needed to have a practical assay for decision making at hand. In fact, easy to use and rapid assays derived from Cytomics or multi‐OMICS approaches are needed to rapidly distinguish severe from mild cases and identify future critically ill individuals before symptom onset. Such a test would clearly take the pressure off of the clinicians because only those with high probability to becoming critically ill would receive intensive care early. Hopefully we will see more related studies in this journal in the near future.","","False","Cytometry Part A","this month|this month|“Machine Learning for Single Cell Data”|Yvan Saeys|Greg Finak|Photonics|San Francisco|BIOS|First|Nature Methods|Method|the Year 2019 1|the last weeks|COVID‐19|2019‐nCoV|2|up to two weeks|two|the past one to two decades|the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS‐CoV|2002/2003|the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome|MERS‐CoV|2012|H1N1|2009/2010|Greta|3|4|CoV|5|6|Immune|6|7|Cytomics","unk","#5479","","","DATE|DATE|WORK_OF_ART|PERSON|PERSON|NORP|GPE|ORG|ORDINAL|WORK_OF_ART|PERSON|EVENT|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|PERSON|DATE|LOC|GPE|DATE|ORG|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|FAC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","WHO","2020-03-01","2949717189","10.1002/cyto.a.23990",""
"Gurwitz, David","Angiotensin receptor blockers as tentative SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics","At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemics combined. Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.","","False","Drug Development Research","February 2020|COVID-19|many months|Influenza|every year|1|2|COVID-19|CoV|the 2002-2003","unk","#4134","","32129518","DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE","WHO","2020-03-04","2002765492","10.1002/ddr.21656",""

By early January 2020 the virus was identified and the sequence determined. The virus (termed SARS‐CoV‐2) shares 88% sequence identity to two coronaviruses found in bats, bat‐SLCoVZC45 and bat‐SL‐CoVZXC21, 79% identity with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and 50% identity with Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [4]. From the first cohort of patients, 8 complete genomes were 99.9% identical in sequence. Given that the typical RNA coronavirus evolves at a rate of 104 nucleotide substitutions per year, this suggests a recent single source emergence in early December or late November 2019 [4]. SARS‐CoV‐2 is thought to be transmitted via contaminated hands, surfaces and aerosolised droplets; extensive human‐to‐human transmission is evident, with clusters of infected families and medical staff [5]. The number of confirmed cases has increased rapidly, at a rate that far outstripped the rate of rise of cases of SARS in 2002/3, raising serious global health concerns.

"Popescu, Saskia","Hospital biopreparedness in the Looming Presence of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19","The recent analysis of 138 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, and their clinical characteristics, has given credence to stronger investments into hospital biopreparedness and overall infection prevention efforts.1 Within this analysis, researchers found two pieces that are particularly relevant to healthcare preparedness: first, that 26% of patients required admission to an intensive care unit, and second, that 41% of cases were related to healthcare transmission. Patients requiring medical care in an intensive care unit inherently burden the system more, both in terms of supplies in personnel, but also because they typically have greater lengths of stay. The volume of healthcare‐associated cases is an indicator of infection prevention breakdowns, which points to the potential for hospitals to further spread the disease. This is not a unique finding, however, and similar situations have been observed in previous coronavirus outbreaks. Indeed, hospitals can easily act as amplifiers for disease transmission during these events. In 2003, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) outbreak in Toronto highlighted this very real vulnerability, where busy emergency departments, delays in isolation, and improper personal protective equipment (PPE) use fueled the spread of disease in several hospitals.2 Enhanced infection prevention measures were eventually implemented (higher level of PPE, masking when in public areas, among others), which helped bring transmission to halt. After the outbreak was believed to be over, however, directives were given to discontinue those enhanced infection prevention measures. As a result of this and staff no longer routinely wearing masks in general hospital areas, a second phase of the outbreak began. An overwhelming majority of cases in Phase II of the Toronto SARS‐CoV were related to healthcare transmission.3","","False","Health Science Reports","138|Wuhan|China|two|first|26%|second|41%|2003|the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS‐CoV|Toronto|PPE|hospitals.2 Enhanced|PPE|second|the Toronto SARS‐CoV","unk","#5577","","","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|PERCENT|ORDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|PERSON|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG","WHO","2020-03-09","","10.1002/hsr2.149",""

This study took an immunoinformatics approach to identify significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitopes in the 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein. Also, interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their corresponding MHC class I supertype representatives prevalent in China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five CTL epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses. Some of these identified epitopes can be potential candidates for development of 2019-nCoV vaccines. This article is protected by copyright.

"Giovanetti, Marta; Benvenuto, Domenico; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo","The first two cases of 2019-nCoV in Italy: where they come from?","ABSTRACT A novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been identified as the causal pathogen of an ongoing epidemic, with the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, last December 2019, and has since spread to other countries worldwide, included Europe and very recently Italy. In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamic of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus 2 closely related bat strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GeneBank. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on the 25th November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19th January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action. This article is protected by copyright.

Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks in order to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and SARS. We confirm high sequence similarity (>99%) between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hyper-variable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches.

Phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood-mapping analyses of the genome sequences were performed. Based on likelihood-mapping analysis, the increasing tree-like signals (from 0 to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time may be indicative of increasing genetic diversity of 2019-nCoV in human hosts. We identified three phylogenetic clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both methods using the above genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains. The estimated mean evolutionary rate for 2019-nCoV ranged from 1.7926 ? 10-3 to 1.8266 ? 10-3 substitutions per site per year.

Although most patients present with mild febrile illness with patchy pulmonary inflammation, a significant portion develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a current case fatality of 2.3-3%. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and laboratory and chest radiographic findings, but confirmation currently relies on nucleic acid-based assays. The latter are playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. Furthermore, there has not been enough time to assess specificity and sensitivity. Conventional serological assays, such as enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for specific IgM and IgG antibodies, should offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected patients.

While several etiological studies have begun to reveal the specific biological features of this virus, the epidemic characteristics need to be elucidated. Notably, a long incubation time was reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to adjustments in screening and control policies. To avoid the risk of virus spread, all potentially exposed subjects are required to be isolated for 14 days, which is the longest predicted incubation time. However, based on our analysis of a larger dataset available so far, we find there is no observable difference between the incubation time for SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS, highlighting the need for larger and well annotated datasets.

Methods Sera were obtained near onset of RI and 3 to 4 weeks later as part of a prospective study of 200 subjects evaluated for RI from 2009 to 2013. Antibodies against common HCoV strains were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assay comparing older adults with cardiopulmonary diseases (99 subjects) to younger, healthy adults (101 subjects). Virus shedding was detected in respiratory secretions by polymerase chain reaction. Results Of 43 HCoV-associated illnesses, 15 (35%) occurred in 14 older adults (aged ≥ 60 years) and 28 (65%) in 28 younger adults (aged 21 to 40 years). Binding and neutralizing antibodies were higher in older adults. Only 16 (35.7%) of RI with increases in binding antibodies also had increases in neutralizing antibodies to HCoV. Increases in binding antibodies with RI were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and virus shedding, and more frequent in younger compared to older adults. Conclusions Functional neutralizing antibodies were not stimulated as often as binding antibodies, explaining in part a susceptibility to reinfection with HCoV.

The virus knowledge is limited and especially about COVID-2019 pathogenesis. The Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of COVID-2019 has been analyzed to evidence the presence of mutation caused by selective pressure on the virus. For selective pressure analysis fast-unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) was used. Homology modelling has been performed by SwissModel and HHPred servers. The presence of transmembrane helical segments in Coronavirus ORF1ab nsp2 and nsp3, was tested by TMHMM, MEMSAT and MEMPACK tools. Three-dimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using PyMOL. FUBAR analysis revealed the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure (p-value < 0.05). Position 723 in the COVID-2019 has a serine instead a glycine residue, while at aminoacidic position 1010 a proline instead an isoleucine. Significant (p < 0.05) pervasive negative selection in 2416 sites (55%) was found. The positive selective pressure could account for some clinical features of this virus compared to SARS and Bat SARS-like CoV. The stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein could account for COVID-2019 high ability of contagious, while the destabilizing mutation in nsp3 proteins could suggest a potential mechanism differentiating COVID-2019 from SARS. These data could be helpful for further investigation aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets or vaccine strategy, especially in the actual moment when the epidemic is ongoing and the scientific community is trying to enrich knowledge about this new viral pathogen.

Currently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes the outbreaks of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered. Until February 18, 2020, there are 72533 confirmed COVID-19 cases (including 10644 severe cases) and 1872 deaths in China. SARS-CoV-2 is surging in the public and caused substantial burdens due to its human-to-human transmission. However, the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. Finding the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to prevent further spread of the epidemic. In this study, we used systematic comparison and analysis to predict the interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of coronavirus spike protein and the host receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interaction between the key amino acids of S protein RBD and ACE2 indicated that like previous suggested pangolins and snacks, the turtles (C. picta bellii, C. mydas, and P. sinensis) may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to human.

Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test.

To explore the potential intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we re-analyzed virome datasets from pangolins and representative SARS-related coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike glycoprotein gene. We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes. Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, which ranged from 22?24 November 2019 and 1.19?1.31 ? 10-3 substitutions per site per year, respectively. Our results also revealed that the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378). We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility. Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins. This article is protected by copyright.

COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0-24 days. The basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 ranges from 2-3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. 3019 health workers were infected by Feb 12, 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan.

By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with slower increase of the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for sars-cov-2 led to the upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals and comprehensive therapeutic strategy.

In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and MERS coronaviruses. METHODS: The genome composition, nucleotides analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage (RESU) and effective number of codons (ENc) were analysed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E), membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important non-structural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS and SARS CoVs. These genes include Spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), Envelop(E) and membrane (M) genes. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with G or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5-20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoV.

SARS-CoV2 belongs to genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. The polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) remains unstudied thoroughly since it is similar to other sarbecoviruses. In this short communication, we performed phylogenetic-structural sequence analysis of pp1ab protein of SARS-CoV2. The analysis showed that the viral pp1ab has not changed in most isolates throughout the outbreak time, but interestingly a deletion of 8 aa in the virulence factor non-structural protein 1 was found in a virus isolated from a Japanese patient that did not display critical symptoms. While comparing pp1ab protein with other betacoronaviruses, we found a 42 amino acid signature that is only present in SARS-CoV2 (AS-SCoV2). Members from clade 2 of sarbecoviruses have traces of this signature. The AS-SCoV2 located in the acidic-domain of papain-like protein of SARS-CoV2 and bat-SL-RatG13 guided us to suggest that the novel 2019 coronavirus probably emerged by genetic drift from bat-SL-CoV-RaTG13. The implication of this amino acid signature in papain-like protein structure arrangement and function is something worth to be explored. This article is protected by copyright.

For coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important protease that catalyze the replication of RNA from RNA template and is an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we screened these chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal compounds proven to show anti-viral activity in SARS-CoV and the similar chemical structures through a molecular docking study to target RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found that theaflavin has a lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp in SARS-CoV-2 (-9.11 kcal/mol), SARS-CoV (-8.03 kcal/mol) and MERS-CoV (-8.26 kcal/mol) from idock. To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin has a lower binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by using the Blind Docking server. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between theaflavin and RdRp. Moreover, one π-cation interaction was formed between theaflavin and Arg553 from the Blind Docking server. Our results suggest that theaflavin could be potential SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor for further study. This article is protected by copyright.

A new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) was soon found to be the cause. At present, the sensitivity of clinical nucleic acid detection is limited, and it is still unclear whether it is related to genetic variation. In this study, we retrieved 95 full-length genomic sequences of SARAS-CoV-2 strains from the NCBI and GISAID databases, established the reference sequence by conducting multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses, and analyzed sequence variations along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The homology among all viral strains was generally high, among them 99.99% (99.91%-100%) at the nucleotide level, 99.99% (99.79%-100%) at the amino acid level. Although overall variation in ORF regions is low, 13 variation sites in 1a, 1b, S, 3a, M, 8, and N regions were identified, among which positions nt28144 in ORF 8 and nt8782 in ORF 1a showed mutation rate of 30.53% (29/95) and 29.47% (28/95) respectively. These findings suggested that there may be selective mutations in SARS-COV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing primers and probes. Establishment of the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 could benefit not only biological study of this virus but also diagnosis, clinical monitoring and intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future.

Therefore, it is of crucial importance to study the initial clinical features of patients, to better differentiate between infected and uninfected patients outside Hubei. METHODS: A total of 116 patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented to two emergency departments in Anhui for the first time between 24 January 2020 and 20 February 2020 were enrolled in the study. The initial clinical data of these patients, such as epidemiological features, symptoms, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography findings were collected using a standard case report form on admission. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19; the remaining 84 patients were referred to as negative cases. The median age of the diagnosed patients was 46 years, but only 35 years for negative cases. History of exposure to Wuhan or COVID-19 patients in the previous 2 weeks was observed in 63% of the diagnosed and 44% of negative cases. Median time from illness onset to ED admission was 5 days for all patients, diagnosed patients, and negative cases, respectively. Fever was observed in 27 (84%) and 57 (68%) diagnosed and negative cases, respectively. Nineteen (59%) diagnosed and 24 (29%) negative cases had lymphopenia on admission in ED. A chest CT scan on admission revealed the presence of pneumonia in the majority of the diagnosed patients (30 out of 32, 94%) and in 56 (67%) negative cases. Bilateral involvement and ground-glass opacity (GGO) were present in 91% and 47% of the diagnosed patients. CONCLUSION: The initial clinical features of patients suspected of having COVID-19 in EDs outside Hubei were relatively mild. Meanwhile, diagnosed patients without definite exposure history tend to show more atypical initial clinical features in ED. No initial clinical feature was found to be specific to diagnosed patients, which could allow for early clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in EDs. We recommend strict medical observation and quarantine of all patients suspected of having COVID-19, either in the ED itself or in a dedicated quarantine facility, irrespective of initial clinical features, especially in under-resourced regions without access to rapid nucleic acid amplification tests.

Interestingly, the impact of COVID-19 infection on pregnant women appears to be less severe. Chen et al.9 reported the clinical characteristics of nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the third trimester, which comprised mainly fever and cough. Other symptoms included myalgia, malaise, sore throat, diarrhea and shortness of breath. Data from laboratory tests showed that the majority of patients had lymphopenia and increased C-reactive protein, and chest CT scans showed multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs. Pregnancy complications that appeared after the onset of COVID-19 infection included fetal distress in two of nine patients and premature rupture of the membranes in two of nine patients. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. Another series10 of nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting from mid-trimester onwards, or during the postpartum period, reported similar findings except for one woman requiring ICU care and ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome after the infection was diagnosed 2?days postpartum. In general, both studies reported that the clinical characteristics of the pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia2-4. These observations are also in line with what has been learned about COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy in several other hospitals in Wuhan, China. Pregnant healthcare professionals should follow risk-assessment and infection-control guidelines following exposure to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all healthcare professionals in clinical settings11.","","False","Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology","Clinical|COVID-19|2009|1%|5%|CoV|Middle East|two|ICU|8|COVID-19|Chen|nine|third|CT|COVID-19|two of nine|two of nine|COVID-19|nine|COVID-19|one|2?days|COVID-19|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|COVID-19","unk","#4390","","","ORG|ORG|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|LOC|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|PERSON","WHO","2020-03-05","3005679569","10.1002/uog.22006",""

Camel zoonotic diseases can be encountered in all camel-rearing countries. In this article, all studies carried out on camel zoonotic diseases in Iran are reviewed to show the importance of camels for public health in this country. More than 900 published documents were systematically searched to find relevant studies from 1,890 until late 2018. The collected articles were classified according to the aetiological agents. In this study, 19 important zoonotic diseases were reported among Iranian camels including listeriosis, leptospirosis, plague, Q fever, brucellosis, campylobacteriosis, tuberculosis, pasteurellosis, clostridiosis, salmonellosis, Escherichia coli infections, rabies, camelpox, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, echinococcosis, cryptosporidiosis, toxoplasmosis and dermatophytosis, most of which belong to bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal pathogens, respectively.

"Meyerholz, David K.; Beck, Amanda P.","Histopathologic Evaluation and Scoring of Viral Lung Infection","Emergent coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV can cause significant morbidity and mortality in infected individuals. Lung infection is a common clinical feature and contributes to disease severity as well as viral transmission. Animal models are often required to study viral infections and therapies, especially during an initial outbreak. Histopathology studies allow for identification of lesions and affected cell types to better understand viral pathogenesis and clarify effective therapies. Use of immunostaining allows detection of presumed viral receptors and viral tropism for cells can be evaluated to correlate with lesions. In the lung, lesions and immunostaining can be qualitatively described to define the cell types, microanatomic location, and type of changes seen. These features are important and necessary, but this approach can have limitations when comparing treatment groups. Semiquantitative and quantitative tissue scores are more rigorous as these provide the ability to statistically compare groups and increase the reproducibility and rigor of the study. This review describes principles, approaches, and resources that can be useful to evaluate coronavirus lung infection, focusing on MER-CoV infection as the principal example.","","False","MERS Coronavirus","CoV|MER-CoV","unk","#3837","","31883098","PERSON|ORG","WHO","2019-12-28","2996797247","10.1007/978-1-0716-0211-9_16",""

Coronavirus (CoV) has an exceptionally large RNA genome (~30kb) and it encodes an essential replicase, the nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13), a member of superfamily 1 helicases. Nsp13 is among the evolutionary most conserved proteins not only in CoVs but also in nidovirales. Thus, it is considered as an important drug target. However, the high-resolution structure of CoV nsp13 remained unavailable even until more than a decade after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, which hindered the structure-based drug design. This is in part due to the intrinsic flexibility of nsp13. Here, we describe protocols of deducing the crystal structure of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) helicase in detail, which include protein expression, purification, crystallization, enzymatic characterization, and structure determination. With these methods, catalytically active recombinant MERS-CoV nsp13 protein can be prepared and crystallized and the crystal structure can be solved.","","False","MERS Coronavirus","RNA|7|Coronavirus|CoV|RNA|13 (nsp13)|1|Nsp13|CoVs|CoV|more than a decade|2003|Middle East|CoV|CoV","unk","#4045","","31883088","ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|LOC|PERSON|DATE|DATE|LOC|PERSON|PERSON","WHO","2019-12-28","2997961760","10.1007/978-1-0716-0211-9_6",""

Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation. Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI.

The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19. METHODS: A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID-19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. RESULTS: A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury.

Since PDCoV was first detected in 2009 in Hong Kong, the prevalence of PDCoV has increased in recent years, resulting in serious economic losses to the swine industry. The coronavirus spike (S) protein is an antigen that has been demonstrated to contain epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies. The presence of serum and milk IgA antibodies against pathogens that replicate primarily on mucosal surfaces is important for mucosal immunity. Here, an indirect anti-PDCoV IgA antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PDCoV S1 IgA ELISA) using the purified S1 portion of S protein as the coating antigen was developed to detect PDCoV IgA antibodies in serum and sow's milk. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed high specificity and sensitivity of the PDCoV-S1-IgA-ELISA based on samples confirmed by IFA. Anti-PDCoV IgA antibodies in 152 serum samples and 65 milk samples collected from six farms that had experienced diarrhea outbreaks within previous last two years were detected by this assay, and 62.5% of the serum samples and 100% of the milk samples were positive for PDCoV. The indirect ELISA method established in this study will provide a convenient tool for measurement of serum and milk IgA levels against PDCoV in pig herds, rapid detection of PDCoV infection in pigs, and evaluation of the immunogenicity of vaccines.","","False","Archives of Virology","PDCoV|first|2009|Hong Kong|PDCoV|recent years|IgA|IgA|enzyme|PDCoV S1 IgA ELISA|S|IgA|ROC|IFA|Anti-PDCoV|IgA|152|65|six|previous last two years|62.5%|100%|ELISA|IgA|PDCoV","unk","#877","","32052195","GPE|ORDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|FAC|GPE|ORG|ORG|FAC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|GPE","WHO","2020-02-12","3006146227","10.1007/s00705-020-04541-6",""

A Review of Historical Classics, Research Evidence and Current Prevention Programs","OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China. This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies. METHODS: Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. RESULTS: The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). CONCLUSIONS: Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population.

The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.","","False","The Indian Journal of Pediatrics","2019|2019-nCoV|2|Wuhan|Hubei|China|December 2019|around 96,000|2019|3300|2|14|ARDS|2 to 3%|two|Middle East","unk","#8490","","","DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|LOC","WHO","2020-03-13","","10.1007/s12098-020-03263-6",""

It demonstrates that both air change and exhaust airflow rates have significant effects on not only the airflow but also the particle distribution within a mechanically ventilated space. Moreover, the location of an infected patient within the ward cubicle is crucial in determining the extent of infection risk to other ward occupants. Hence, it is recommended to provide exhaust grilles in close proximity to a patient, preferably above each patient’s bed. To achieve infection prevention and control, high exhaust airflow rate is also suggested.

"Zhao, Shilei; Chen, Hua","Modeling the epidemic dynamics and control of COVID-19 outbreak in China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading in China and more than 30 countries over last two months. COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R > 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R < 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities. A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in China, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). Note that the estimates are from a deterministic ODE model and should be interpreted with some uncertainty. We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other countries at high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran.","","False","Quantitative Biology","2019|COVID-19|China|more than 30|last two months|COVID-19|Susceptible|Un|Quarantined|Confirmed|COVID-19|SUQC|COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei|Wuhan|China|Hubei|four|first|China|January 30, 2020|Beijing|1|January 30|COVID-19|Wuhan|0.0643|Hubei|Wuhan|China|Hubei|0.2189|0.3229|February 12|Wuhan|February 12, 2020|3,509|334|February 21, 2020|February 21, 2020|COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei|around late March|around mid March|China|Hubei|early March 2020|four|one|80,511|China|49,510|Wuhan|17,679|Hubei|Wuhan|13,322|China|Hubei|ODE|before early March|Beijing|Shanghai|Guangzhou|Shenzhen|late March|Hubei|South Korea|Japan|Italy|Iran","unk","#8545","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE","WHO","2020-03-11","","10.1007/s40484-020-0199-0",""

In this study, the main objectives were to evaluate the in vitro aerodynamic deposition profiles of nebulizer generated aerosols and comparatively investigate the local drug availability and anti-inflammatory efficacy of DAS between intratracheal and intravenous dosing. The in vitro evaluation of aerodynamic characteristics and droplet size distribution showed more than 50% aerosol particles with size being < 5 μm, allowing the aerosols to reach the lower respiratory tract. Following intratracheal administration, the drug underwent pulmonary absorption into the bloodstream, rendering an absolute bioavailability of 47.3%. Compared to the intravenous delivery, the intratracheal administration dramatically increased the drug availability in the lung tissue in rats by more than 80-fold, leading to an improved and prolonged local anti-inflammatory efficacy in a lipopolysaccharide induced lung injury model in mice.

However, little is known worldwide regarding the PM1-associated health effects due to a wide lack of ground-based PM1 measurements from air monitoring stations. Methods We collected daily records of hospital admission for respiratory diseases and station-based measurements of air pollution and weather conditions in Shenzhen, China, 2015–2016. Time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were adopted to estimate hospitalization risks associated with short-term exposures to PM1 and PM2.5. Results PM1 and PM2.5 showed significant adverse effects on respiratory disease hospitalizations, while no evident associations with PM1–2.5 were identified. Admission risks for total respiratory diseases were 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.14) and 1.06 (1.02 to 1.10), corresponding to per 10 μg/m3 rise in exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 at lag 0–2 days, respectively. Both PM1 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with increased admission for pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, but exhibited no effects on asthma and upper respiratory tract infection. Largely comparable risk estimates were observed between male and female patients. Groups aged 0–14 years and 45–74 years were significantly affected by PM1- and PM2.5-associated risks. PM-hospitalization associations exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, with significantly larger risks in cold season than those in warm season among some subgroups.

For the clinical cure criteria in China, twice successive negative results of Sars-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection are the important index, in addition to normal body temperature for 3 days as well as obvious improvement in respiratory symptoms and CT scan [2]. In the present work, we reported that Sars-Cov-2 nucleic acid was still detectable in sputum obtained by nebulization from a cured patient. On January 22, a 49-year-old man presented himself with fever for 4 days to a clinic. Throat swab detection was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time RT-PCR. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the diagnostic criteria [2] as follows (1): the positive result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection (2); a history of short stay in Wuhan within 14 days; and (3) symptoms of fever, and multiple patchy areas of ground-glass opacity on CT scan. After the active treatment, the patient recovered from fever and other respiratory symptoms on February 4. On February 9 and February 10, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was successively negative in his throat swab samples. The CT scan result showed that the inflammation was significantly decreased in both lungs.

Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.","","False","Nature Microbiology","the past 20 years|first|thousands","unk","#1966","","32094589","DATE|ORDINAL|CARDINAL","WHO","2020-02-24","3006448444","10.1038/s41564-020-0688-y",""

Despite its putative role in viral RNA replication, nsP13 readily unwinds duplex DNA by cooperative translocation. Herein, nsP13 exhibited different characteristics in duplex RNA unwinding than that in duplex DNA. nsP13 showed very poor processivity on duplex RNA compared with that on duplex DNA. More importantly, nsP13 inefficiently unwinds duplex RNA by increasing the 5'-ss tail length. As the concentration of nsP13 increased, the amount of unwound duplex DNA increased and that of unwound duplex RNA decreased. The accumulation of duplex RNA/nsP13 complexes increased as the concentration of nsP13 increased. An increased ATP concentration in the unwinding of duplex RNA relieved the decrease in duplex RNA unwinding. Thus, nsP13 has a strong affinity for duplex RNA as a substrate for the unwinding reaction, which requires increased ATPs to processively unwind duplex RNA. Our results suggest that duplex RNA is a preferred substrate for the helicase activity of nsP13 than duplex DNA at high ATP concentrations.","","False","Scientific Reports","13|1|RNA|RNA|5|RNA|Herein|nsP13|RNA|RNA|RNA|5'-ss|RNA|RNA/|RNA|RNA|nsP13|RNA|RNA|RNA","unk","#7753","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG","WHO","2020-03-11","","10.1038/s41598-020-61432-1",""

METHODS We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).

Now we also face an immediate crisis. In the past week, Covid-19 has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we’ve been worried about. I hope it’s not that bad, but we should assume it will be until we know otherwise. There are two reasons that Covid-19 is such a threat. First, it can kill healthy adults in addition to elderly people with existing health problems.

Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS-CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS-CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogues. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i+3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based assays.","","False","Journal of Biological Chemistry","2|Remdesivir|RDV|RNA|CoV|Middle East|RDV|RNA|RNA|CoV|nsp8|RDV|nsp8|RDV|RDV|ATP|two|RNA|RNA|three|3'-5|RDV|RNA","unk","#1988","","32094225","CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|LOC|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG","WHO","2020-02-24","2749506538","10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056",""

The numerical simulations exhibit the dynamic system with the external source is more reliable than the one without it, and the rate of isolation is extremely important for controlling the increase of cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV. Based on our numerical simulation results with the public data, we suggest that the local government should have some more strict measures to maintain the rate of isolation. Otherwise the local cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV might be out of control.","","False","Applicable Analysis","2019|CoronaVirus|2019-nCov|China|2019-nCoV.|2019-nCoV.|2019-nCoV","unk","#2331","","","DATE|ORG|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","WHO","2020-02-26","3005139704","10.1080/00036811.2020.1732357",""

"Kidman, Gillian; Chang, Chew-Hung","What does “crisis” education look like?","In the recent issues of IRGEE, we have been asking a few questions, trying to look into the crystal ball of our shared futures. We have been asking questions about how well we are preparing children as tomorrow’s citizens and leaders, and if they will have the dispositions, skills and knowledge to take the planet forward for future generations. To try to answer these questions we considered current events happening in both the editors’ local contexts as well as in global events. For instance, the concerns of drought and bush fires in Australia accompanied politicians arguing over swimming pools and women’s sporting facility funding, and there was another attempted political party leadership takeover. In Singapore, people took different stands on the ban on personal mobility devices on pedestrian pavement. At the global level, news about Brexit and the coming United States elections were prominently featured on headlines. More recently, we were alerted to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis affecting many countries around the world. While there have been discussions of 21st century competencies that our children will need to flourish in a future economy, one in which some of their jobs have not been even invented yet, there is another aspect of future-ready education that we need to address—education in times of crisis. During these times of crises, how information is produced and consumed has immense impact on society and economy, and education has an important part to play in ensuring that people are able to interpret accurately the information they come into contact with. Broadly defined, “crisis education” should examine how education is able to address the knowledge, skills and dispositions required for people in precarious times. Given that the COVID-19 event is recent and its potential impact on longer term global movement of people and resources have yet to be seen, we explore the social aspects of this crisis and highlight the impact of misinformation circulating on social media. A review of past IRGEE papers exploring ‘crisis education’ is used to explore the role of geographical and environmental education in combatting the impact of this misinformation. This year we become aware of the COVID-19 outbreak on 31 December 2019. At least tens of thousands of people have been infected and the death toll in China alone has exceeded that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARs) outbreak (figures are taken from the World Health Organization website as of 10 February 2020). The media reminds us of other past deadly virus outbreaks like SARs and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. Unfortunately, unlike SARS and MERS, the current crisis coincided with the period just prior to and during the Lunar New Year, when traditionally millions of people in China and around the world travel back to their hometowns to celebrate the Lunar New Year. This greatly facilitated the spread of the virus during the initial incubation period. The news media are keeping the world updated on processes and procedures, explaining the need for quarantine periods and the need to keep calm and to be cognizant of the heightened general hygiene requirements. Speculation is beginning on the possibilities of what the worldwide economic and social impact of the COVID-19 will be. Unfortunately, what we are also seeing and hearing is the spread of misinformation—information that is false, but not created with the intention of causing harm (e.g., someone posting an idea containing erroneous information, but not realizing it is erroneous). We are seeing misinformation circulated largely on social media, but also in the conventional and digital news outlets.","","False","International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education","IRGEE|tomorrow|editors’|Australia|Singapore|Brexit|United States|2019|Novel Coronavirus|COVID-19|21st century|one|Broadly|This year|COVID-19|31 December 2019|At least tens of thousands|China|the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|the World Health Organization|10 February 2020|Middle East|the Lunar New Year|millions|China|the Lunar New Year|COVID-19","unk","#6192","","","ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|DATE|PERSON|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|DATE|LOC|EVENT|CARDINAL|GPE|EVENT|ORG","WHO","2020-03-10","","10.1080/10382046.2020.1730095",""

This crisis has attracted intense media attention. Recently, some media outlets inappropriately labelled the coronavirus by race, using such headlines as ?Chinese virus pandemonium? and even suggesting ?China kids stay home.? The biased and misleading coverage presented via Western media channels has incited anger throughout the Chinese community and has placed undue stress upon Chinese individuals living outside China. This post-published review takes a tourism-focused perspective to examine findings from a quantitative study (Rodriguez-Seijas, Stohl, Hasin, & Eaton, 2015) published in 2015 in JAMA Psychiatry. The current paper highlights the potential impacts of misleading and biased media coverage on Chinese individuals? mental health. Specifically, this work considers perceived racial discrimination stemming from coronavirus as a public health crisis and the effects of such discrimination on individuals of Chinese heritage. Similarly imperative are pertinent effects on country image and destination image with respect to tourism marketing and tourist behaviour during times of crisis. By considering racism in the context of the coronavirus outbreak, this paper identifies potential avenues for relevant research in tourism and hospitality.","","False","Anatolia","Wuhan|China|the World Health Organization|31st January 2020|Beijing|Chinese|China|Western|Chinese|Chinese|China|Rodriguez-Seijas|Stohl|Hasin|& Eaton|2015|2015|JAMA Psychiatry|Chinese|Chinese","unk","#1021","","","GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|GPE|NORP|GPE|NORP|NORP|NORP|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|DATE|PERSON|NORP|NORP","WHO","2020-02-16","2783117446","10.1080/13032917.2020.1730621",""

The Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that the 2019-2020 nCoV most probably originated from the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the Rhinolophus bat family. In agreement with epidemiological observations, the most likely geographic origin of the new outbreak was the city of Wuhan, China, where 2019-nCoV time of the most recent common ancestor emerged, according to molecular clock analysis, around November 25(th), 2019. These results, together with previously recorded epidemics, suggest a recurring pattern of periodical epizootic outbreaks due to Betacoronavirus.

Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.

Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery, zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes. Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are also discussed.","","False","Emerging Microbes & Infections","World Health Organization|2019|COVID-19|International Concern|2|the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.|Middle East","unk","#8788","","","ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|LOC","WHO","2020-01-01","","10.1080/22221751.2020.1735265",""

Raina","Selection and Use of Respiratory Protection by Healthcare Workers to Protect from Infectious Diseases in Hospital Settings","Abstract Objectives Infection control policies and guidelines recommend using facemasks and respirators to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from respiratory infections. Common types of respirators used in healthcare settings are filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). Aims of this study were to examine the current attitudes and practices of HCWs regarding the selection and use of respiratory protection and determine the acceptability of a novel PAPR. Methods In-depth interviews were undertaken with 20 HCWs from a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia. Participants were fit tested with a lightweight tight-fitting half-facepiece PAPR (CleanSpace2™ Power Unit, PAF-0034, by CleanSpace Technology®) using the TSI™ Portacount quantitative fit test method. Results Interview results showed that HCWs had a limited role in the selection and use of facemasks and respirators and had been using the devices provided by the hospital. The majority of subjects had no knowledge of hospital policy for the use of facemasks and respirators, had not been trained on the use of respirators, and had not been fit tested previously. Compliance with the use of facemasks and respirators was perceived as being low and facemasks and respirators were typically used only for short periods of time. All 20 participants were successfully fit tested to the CleanSpace2™ PAPR (overall geometric mean fit factor—6768). According to the exit surveys, CleanSpace2™ PAPRs were easy to don (14/20) and doff (15/20) and comfortable to wear (14/20). Most participants believed that PAPRs provide higher protection, comfort and reusability over N95 FFR and can be used during pandemics and other high-risk situations. Conclusions HCWs should be aware of infection control policies and training should be provided on the correct use of respiratory protective devices. PAPRs can be used in hospital settings to protect HCWs from certain highly infectious and emerging pathogens, however, HCWs require adequate training on storage, use, and cleaning of PAPRs.","","False","Annals of Work Exposures and Health","PAPR|20|tertiary|Sydney|Australia|half|PAPR|™ Power Unit|CleanSpace Technology|20|PAPR|fit factor—6768|CleanSpace2™|14/20|15/20|14/20|N95 FFR","unk","#5147","","","ORG|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|TIME|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON","WHO","2020-03-07","2800868152","10.1093/annweh/wxaa020",""
"Brosseau, Lisa M.","Are Powered Air Purifying Respirators a Solution for Protecting Healthcare Workers from Emerging Aerosol-Transmissible Diseases?","For the third time in less than 20 years there is global concern about a novel coronavirus causing significant respiratory morbidity and mortality. The first cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) were reported by China to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2003; one-third of these were among healthcare workers (WHO, 2003). By the end of the outbreak in 2004, more than half (378; 57%) of the 667 SARS cases treated in Asian and Canadian outbreak hospitals were healthcare workers or medical students (Sepkowitz and Eisenberg, 2005). At the time of and for many years after the SARS outbreak, there was much consternation among the medical and infectious disease communities about the organism's mode(s) of transmission. Aerosols (both fine particles and larger droplets) had to be at least partially responsible for the relative ease with which SARS was transmitted from person to person. As more detailed epi-demiologic data were published, this proved to be the case-risk factors for nosocomial transmission of SARS included exposure during aerosol-generating medical procedures, failure to isolate infectious patients, and the lack or uneven use of personal protective equipment (Scales et al., 2003; Fowler et al., 2004; Ofner-Agostini et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009). In May 2014, when the first cases of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) were reported in the USA 2 years after initial outbreaks in Saudi Arabia, Dr Rachael Jones and I published a Commentary on the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Practice website (Brosseau and Jones, 2014). We argued that MERS was likely an aerosol-transmissible disease, because it resulted in symptoms similar to SARS (cough, diarrhea, and vomiting) and patients would likely undergo aerosol-generating procedures, such as intub-ation and bronchoscopy. As with SARS, early data suggested aerosol transmission of MERS among hospital patients located at some distance from each other. As with SARS, the MERS coronavirus remains viable as an aerosol and on surfaces for long periods of time at low relative humidity. We argued that healthcare workers should be provided with fit-tested N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), at a minimum, when caring for MERS patients. For exposures to high concentrations of infectious particles, such as from patients experiencing severe symptoms or during aerosol-generating procedures , we recommended that healthcare workers should be wearing powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs), which offer a higher degree of protection than FFRs. At the time of our Commentary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was recommending contact, droplet, and airborne precautions for MERS; WHO was recommending only contact and droplet precautions.

METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade A hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction.

The fast sharing of 2019-nCoV genomes in GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org) provides a valuable dataset for 2019-nCoV haplotype network analysis, which is crucial for transmission and evolutionary track surveillance and secondary outbreak prevention. We called single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) for all the 84 2019-nCov genomes in GISAID using MN908947 as the reference. Genomes with same SNVs are grouped into a haplotype (shown as a pie chart node in Fig. 1, see Tab.

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 μM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.

Related clinical features are needed. Methods We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan between January 16 to January 29, 2020. All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020. Results The median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46%) were men. The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]), cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]). Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients). As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%. According to the lowest SpO2 during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2≥90% group (n=55) and the SpO2<90% group (n=14). All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2<90% group. Compared with SpO2≥90% group, patients of the SpO2<90% group were older, and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c reactive protein. Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate. Conclusions COVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%. Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death.","","False","Clinical Infectious Diseases","December 2019 to February 2020, 2019|2|2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|69|Union hospital|Wuhan|between January 16 to January 29, 2020|February 4, 2020|69|42.0 years|35.0|32|46%|60[87%|38[55%|29[42%|66|98.5%|67|66|98.5%|67|February 4, 2020|18 (26.9%|67|five|7.5%|SpO2≥90%|SpO2<90%|n=14|5|SpO2<90%|SpO2≥90%|SpO2<90%|IL10|7.5%","unk","#8628","","32176772","DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|FAC|GPE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT","WHO","2020-03-16","","10.1093/cid/ciaa272",""

Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by mutations and natural selection besides recombination. Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. Although the L type (∼70%) is more prevalent than the S type (∼30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure. These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","","False","National Science Review","late December 2019|Wuhan|China|China|Herein|only 4%|SARSr-CoV|17%|two|RBD|103|two|L and S|two|∼70%|∼30%|Wuhan|L|early January 2020|L|2019|COVID-19","unk","#3293","","","DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|ORG","WHO","2020-03-03","2377437096","10.1093/nsr/nwaa036",""

The virus has since rapidly spread to all provinces and autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China. Patients who become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to subsequently develop serious lower respiratory disease. The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labelled, randomised controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at 4 consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those without such facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2X infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 μmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 μmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 μmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 ± 0.02] × 10vs. 1.00 ± 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 μmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP has potent antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00 ± 0.37 vs. 0.46 ± 0.12, t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 ± 0.43 vs. [6.18 ± 0.95] × 10, t = 3.98, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.","","False","Chinese Medical Journal","2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|2019|COVID-19|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi|GX_P2X|enzyme 2|RNA|2019-nCoV|Two|2406|Vero|GX_P2X|GX_P2V|92.2%|2019-nCoV|Wuhan|2019-nCoV.|Three|CEP|10|GX_P2V|50%|0.98|RNA|10|15,393-fold|CEP|6.48 ± 0.02|10vs|1.00|150.38|0.001|72|10|48|CEP|1.00 ± 0.37|0.46 ± 0.12|2.42|0.05|1.00|±|0.43|6.18|10|3.98|0.05|GX_P2V|2019-nCoV|CEP|2019-nCoV|CEP|CEP|2019-nCoV","unk","#5781","","32149769","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|MONEY|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|MONEY|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","WHO","2020-03-01","","10.1097/CM9.0000000000000797",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 from January to February 2020. The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed and the relationship between them was analyzed. RESULTS: Totally 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58/80 (73%) of patients had cough, 61/80 (76%) of patients had high temperature levels. The most frequent CT abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (GGO) (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%) and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%). Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12±6 lung segments involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%) and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%). The average pulmonary inflammation index (PII) value was (34%±20%) for all the patients. Correlation analysis showed that the PII value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from illness onset and body temperature (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The common chest CT findings of COVID-19 are multiple GGO, consolidation and interlobular septal thickening in both lungs, which are mostly distributed under the pleura. There are significant correlations between the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms and laboratory results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including 25 severe/critical cases and 58 ordinary cases were enrolled. The chest CT images and clinical data of them were reviewed and compared. The risk factors associated with disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the ordinary patients, the severe/critical patients had older ages, higher incidence of comorbidities, cough, expectoration, chest pain and dyspnea. The incidences of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern and bronchial wall thickening in severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients. Besides, severe/critical patients showed higher incidences of lymph node enlargement, pericardial effusion and pleural effusion than the ordinary patients. The CT scores of severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the sensitivity and specificity of CT Score were 80.0% and 82.8% respectively for the discrimination of the two types. The clinical factors of age > 50 years old, comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, expectoration, decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation indicators were risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. CT findings of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, high CT scores and extrapulmonary lesions were features of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations and CT manifestations between the ordinary patients and the severe/critical patients.

We aimed to quantify severity of COVID-19 infection on High-Resolution CT and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From Jan 11, 2020, to Feb 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory and HRCT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five (83%) patients exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips and air bronchograms, compared to initial CT (all p<0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R=0.68, p<0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R range 0.36-0.75, p<0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (p=0.001-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground-grass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements.

We now expect global GDP growth to slow to just 1.9% y/y in Q1 this year and have lowered our forecast for 2020 as a whole from 2.5% to 2.3%, down from 2.6% in 2019. ▀ Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, there had been signs that the worst was over for both world trade and the manufacturing sector. However, this tentative optimism has been dashed by the current disruption. ▀ While the near-term impact of the virus is uncertain, the disruption to China will clearly be significant in Q1 ? we expect Chinese GDP growth to plunge to just 3.8% y/y. Even though growth there will rebound in Q2 and Q3, it will take time for the loss in activity to be fully recovered and we now expect GDP growth of just 5.4% for 2020 as a whole, a downward revision of 0.6pp from last month. ▀ Weaker Chinese imports and tourism and disruption to global supply chains will take a toll on the rest of the world, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. And the shock will exacerbate the ongoing slowdown in the US and may result in the eurozone barely expanding for a second quarter running in Q1. ▀ Weaker oil demand in the short term has prompted us to lower our Brent oil price forecast. We have cut our projection for growth in crude demand in 2020 by 0.2m b/d to 0.9 mb/d and now forecast Brent crude will average $62.4pb in 2020, down from about $65pb in our January forecast. ▀ Quarterly global growth is likely to strengthen a little in H2 this year as the disruption fades and firms make up for the lost output earlier in the year and the effect of China's policy response starts to feed through.

So we call upon all the first-line medical staff to be cautious and pay more attention to those untypical patients especially from the epidemic area. Besides, as the viral nucleic acids could be found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients with COVID-19 infection, the possibility of fecal-oral transmission need to be took into account. Based on the previously and recently studies, we speculate that COVID-19 may have some relationship with the gut microbiota through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, thus targeting gut microbiota might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of virus-related pneumonia.

"Abernethy, Katharine","Editorial 58(1)","As I write, the world is gripped by news of a novel coronavirus sweeping across the planet. The epidemic is causing terrible anguish to many thousands of families and astounding economic damage in Asia. Whilst yet unconfirmed, several research results now point at the hunting, trade and consumption of pangolins as a likely source of the epidemic. Whether or not pangolins do finally prove to be at the origin of this particular virus, the research highlights that the possibility is very real. This may turn out to be a turning point for pangolin conservation, perhaps for the conservation of a great many other species. In 2015, the IUCN Species Survival Commission Pangolin Specialist Group reported concerns that the profound decline in Asian pangolins would lead to traffickers procuring supplies from Africa. The next five years saw their predictions largely fulfilled. Robust results from a range of research approaches showed first an increase in trade and value of pangolins within the West and central Africa and, more recently, growing international trafficking, with China and Vietnam as major destinations. In 2016, the CITES 17th Conference of Parties moved all African pangolin species onto Appendix 1. Not a single research paper published on pangolins in the past 5 years has suggested anything other than desperate jeopardy for all eight of the world’s species. All available researches point to increasing harvesting, with the rise ultimately driven by trade for profit. The plight of over‐hunted pangolins has become a rallying call for conservation over the past few years. New NGO and government funding initiatives have arisen, dedicated to research for their conservation. The dramatically steep decline of the Asian species has been written about in both Science and Nature, the most widely read scientific journals of the day, in the last few years. The pangolin, alongside the elephant, is a poster species for action against the illegal wildlife trade. However, the research community’s awareness of the impending doom has not in the least stemmed the trade. This issue contains a Short Communication reporting for the first time trade in pangolins in yet another country, South Sudan. I am unsure of what the public response to the possibility that pangolins can transmit deadly viruses will be. I hope it is to leave them alone, rather than to try to eradicate them. This Journal remains committed to improving knowledge of the African ecosystems and increasingly to reporting research that shows how they are changing in the face of our actions. This issue, as each issue, makes a new and relevant contribution to that objective.","","False","African Journal of Ecology","thousands|Asia|2015|the IUCN Species Survival Commission Pangolin Specialist Group|Asian|Africa|The next five years|Robust|first|West|Africa|China|Vietnam|2016|the CITES 17th Conference of Parties|African|Appendix 1|the past 5 years|all eight|the past few years|Asian|Science|Nature|the day|the last few years|Short Communication|first|South Sudan|Journal|African","unk","#3469","","","CARDINAL|LOC|DATE|ORG|NORP|LOC|DATE|GPE|ORDINAL|LOC|LOC|GPE|GPE|DATE|EVENT|NORP|ORG|DATE|DATE|DATE|NORP|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORDINAL|LOC|ORG|NORP","WHO","2020-03-01","3000618339","10.1111/aje.12732",""

METHODS: Electronical medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection were extracted and analysed. RESULTS: An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community acquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases was not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) were the most common signs of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r=0.486, p<0.001) and non-severe (r=0.469, p<0.001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to non-severe patients (all p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggest eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis.

"Young, Charles","The world is changing fast!","The world is changing fast! As of 9 February 2020, there now have been at least 813 deaths from a novel strain of coronavirus that is thought to have originated in Wuhan, China (2019-nCoV), at the end of 2019. These deaths are in the context of the 37 558 cases of 2019-nCov which have already been diagnosed in China and multiple other countries.1 In the United Kingdom (UK), recent research by University College London, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, has found that 1 in 20 UK teachers now report long-lasting mental health problems, illustrating a dramatic increase from around 1/100 teachers affected in this way in the 1990s.2 In the United States (US), a recent report by Accenture (Artificial Intelligence [AI]: Healthcare's new nervous system), estimates that AI in health will be worth around $6.6 billion by 2021 and that “…when combined, key clinical health AI applications can potentially create $150 billion in annual savings for the US healthcare economy by 2026.”3 What do these facts and statistics have in common? Taken together they illustrate the massive range and rate of change in health and the responsibility of healthcare globally. In this context a valid question can be asked about the role of general medical journals such as the International Journal of Clinical Practice (IJCP). Having taken over as Editor in Chief of IJCP in January this year, I have the honour of leading an internationally renowned medical journal, with a team of extremely accomplished clinician editors, published by Wiley, one of the world's leading biomedical publishers. In our rapidly changing healthcare world, IJCP is eager, committed and ideally suited to undergo a transition process as well. As a team, our view is that in a healthcare environment of seemingly ever-increasing specialisation, one key role that a Journal such as ours should move to fulfil is to publish important, high quality medical research and opinion that will inform specialist clinicians about important general medical concepts, practical insights and recent advances. Similarly, we will also aim to inform generalists about key speciality medical advances that have relevance to generalists in the provision of care to their patients. In this work a foundational aspect of our editorial approach will be rather than looking for reasons to reject submissions, to clearly identify problems with submitted research and opinion if they exist, and work closely with authors to address these issues, allowing those authors to raise the quality of their work to the highest level. In that context, as well as continuing to publish submissions from internationally important clinicians and medical researchers worldwide, we also see that IJCP should aim to specifically encourage less experienced authors who nonetheless have important information to share with the global healthcare community. In this way, IJCP will drive forward its primary function of improving global health through the dissemination of world leading medical information and debate. The world is changing fast, and IJCP has the energy and vision to change with it!","","False","International Journal of Clinical Practice","9 February 2020|at least 813|Wuhan|China|2019-nCoV|the end of 2019|37 558|2019-nCov|China|the United Kingdom|UK|University College London|the Nuffield Foundation|1|20|UK|around 1/100|1990s.2|the United States|US|Accenture|Healthcare|AI|around $6.6 billion|2021|AI|$150 billion|annual|US|2026.”3|the International Journal of Clinical Practice (IJCP|IJCP|January this year|Wiley|one|IJCP|one|Journal|IJCP|IJCP|IJCP","unk","#2076","","","DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|FAC|GPE|GPE|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|MONEY|DATE|PERSON|MONEY|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE","WHO","2020-02-26","1600193582","10.1111/ijcp.13486",""

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of influenza by collecting randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods We searched PubMed, EMbase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to January 27, 2020 to identify relevant systematic reviews. The RCTs included in systematic reviews were identified. Then we searched the latest published RCTs from the above three databases and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished RCTs. Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate pooled estimates by using RevMan 5.3 software. Results A total of six RCTs involving 9 171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.92-1.28, P > .05), laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.70-1.11), laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.42-1.29) and influenzalike illness (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.14) using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). Conclusion The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza.

In addition, hundreds of more viruses are described without any information on zoonotic potential. We discuss important characteristics of bats including bat biology, evolution, distribution and ecology that not only make them unique among most mammals but also contribute to their potential as viral reservoirs. The detection of a virus in bats does not imply that spillover will occur and several biological, ecological and anthropogenic factors play a role in such an event. We summarize and critically analyse the current knowledge on African bats as reservoirs for corona-, filo-, paramyxo- and lyssaviruses. We highlight that important information on epidemiology, bat biology and ecology is often not available to make informed decisions on zoonotic spillover potential. Even if knowledge gaps exist, it is still important to recognize the role of bats in zoonotic disease outbreaks and implement mitigation strategies to prevent exposure to infectious agents including working safely with bats. Equally important is the crucial role of bats in various ecosystem services.

By means of whole-genome sequence comparisons, we demonstrate that the noncoding flanks of the viral genome can be used to correctly separate the recognized four betacoronavirus subspecies. The conservation would be sufficient to define target sequences that could, in theory, classify novel virus species into their subspecies. Only 253 upstream noncoding sequences of Sarbecovirus are sufficient to identify genetic similarities between species of this subgenus. Furthermore, it was investigated which bat species have commercial value in China, and would thus likely be handled for trading purposes. A number of coronavirus genomes have been published that were obtained from such bat species. These bats are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and their handling poses a potential risk to cause zoonotic coronavirus epidemics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The noncoding upstream and downstream flanks of coronavirus genomes allow for rapid classification of novel Betacoronavirus species and correct identification of genetic relationships. Although bats are the likely natural host of 2019_nCoV, the exact bat species that serves as the natural host of the virus remains as yet unknown. Chinese bat species with commercial value were identified as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Since their trading provides a potential risk for spreading zoonoses, a change in these practices is highly recommended.","","False","Letters in Applied Microbiology","Betacoronavirus|four|Only 253|Sarbecovirus|China|Traditional Chinese Medicine|SIGNIFICANCE|Betacoronavirus|2019_nCoV|Chinese|Traditional Chinese Medicine","unk","#4187","","32060933","ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG","WHO","2020-02-28","3006608991","10.1111/lam.13285",""

As of early February 2020, China bears the large burden of morbidity and mortality, whereas the incidence in other Asian countries, in Europe and North America remains low so far.","","False","Tropical Medicine & International Health","Covid-19|2019|2019-nCoV|Hubei Province|the People's Republic of China|January 30, 2020|the WHO Emergency Committee|Chinese|hourly|daily|Johns Hopkins University|1|early February 2020|China|Asian|Europe|North America","unk","#722","","","PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|NORP|TIME|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|NORP|LOC|LOC","WHO","2020-02-16","3006419170","10.1111/tmi.13383",""

In this study, the ability of the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets and THERAFLEX MB-Plasma pathogen inactivation systems to inactivate these viruses in platelet concentrates and plasma, respectively, was investigated. Materials and methods Blood products were spiked with SARS-CoV, CCHFV or NiV, and then treated with increasing doses of UVC light (THERAFLEX UV-Platelets) or with methylene blue (MB) plus increasing doses of visible light (MB/light; THERAFLEX MB-Plasma). Samples were taken before and after treatment with each illumination dose and tested for residual infectivity. Results Treatment with half to three-fourths of the full UVC dose (0 center dot 2 J/cm(2)) reduced the infectivity of SARS-CoV (>= 3 center dot 4 log), CCHFV (>= 2 center dot 2 log) and NiV (>= 4 center dot 3 log) to the limit of detection (LOD) in platelet concentrates, and treatment with MB and a fourth of the full light dose (120 J/cm(2)) decreased that of SARS-CoV (>= 3 center dot 1 log), CCHFV (>= 3 center dot 2 log) and NiV (>= 2 center dot 7 log) to the LOD in plasma. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that both THERAFLEX UV-Platelets (UVC) and THERAFLEX MB-Plasma (MB/light) effectively reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV, CCHFV and NiV in platelet concentrates and plasma, respectively.","","False","Vox Sanguinis","CCHFV|NiV|THERAFLEX MB-Plasma|Blood|CCHFV|NiV|UVC|MB|THERAFLEX MB-Plasma|half to three-fourths|UVC|J/cm(2|CoV|3|4|CCHFV|2|2|NiV|4|3|LOD|MB|120|J/cm(2|CoV|3|1|CCHFV|3|2|NiV|2|7|LOD|UVC|THERAFLEX MB-Plasma|CCHFV|NiV","unk","#4078","","","ORG|PERSON|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|QUANTITY|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","WHO","2020-01-12","3000244297","10.1111/vox.12888",""

The problem began in 2018 when unusually heavy rains on the Arabian Peninsula allowed populations to boom over several generations. In October 2019, the locusts swarmed south into Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia, and in late December, they spread to Kenya, causing the worst infestation there in 70 years. Somalia—which last week declared a national emergency and asked for increased food aid—has already lost 100,000 hectares of crops and pasture. Another generation of locusts will likely hatch this month and cause more damage. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations called for $70 million to fight the outbreak with pesticides and help farmers. ### Glaciology After dropping sensors and a torpedo-shaped robot through a 700-meter hole in the ice, scientists in Antarctica last week revealed the first direct evidence that warm ocean temperatures around the rapidly retreating Thwaites Glacier could destabilize the key ice sheet. Researchers are worried because Thwaites—larger than the state of Illinois—helps block the ocean from reaching and warming the even bigger, unstable West Antarctic Ice Sheet, whose melting could eventually drive meters of sea level rise. Battling 2 months of stormy conditions, the team measured ocean waters beneath Thwaites at more than 2°C above the freezing point. The robot, Icefin (above, shown operating elsewhere in Antarctica), provided the first images of the glacier's grounding zone, the mysterious boundary where the floating coastal ice sheet attaches to bedrock. The project is part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a multiyear effort by the United States and the United Kingdom that is wrapping up its first full field season. ### Leadership Some researchers in Colombia are calling for a little-known molecular biologist appointed as the country's first ever science minister to resign. They are outraged by reports that she treated cancer patients with a fungal extract, without running a formal clinical trial. “We can only regret that the course of how to do science in our country has been left in the hands of pseudoscience,” the Colombian Association of Medical Faculties wrote in a statement. In December 2019, Mabel Gisela Torres Torres was appointed to lead the newly created Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. In January, she told a newspaper she did not seek formal ethical, safety, and efficacy reviews of her work with patients because she believed the fungus posed no threat to human health. Her Ph.D. adviser has defended her and notes that metabolites in the fungi Torres studied have shown potential as a cancer treatment in cell and mouse studies. ### Environmental science ![Figure][2] CREDITS: (GRAPHIC) J. BRAINARD/ SCIENCE ; (DATA) UNITED NATIONS UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE FOR WATER, ENVIRONMENT, AND HEALTH The world's growing flows of wastewater offer a largely untapped, potentially lucrative source of energy, agricultural fertilizers, and water for irrigation, a comprehensive study says. The opportunities will increase as the annual volume of wastewater—now 380 billion cubic meters—expands by an estimated 51% by 2050, as populations and incomes multiply, says a team led by researchers at United Nations University's Institute for Water, Environment, and Health. About 13% of global demand for fertilizer could be met by recovering nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash from wastewater; such use provides a bonus, diverting nutrients from waterways, where they can create harmful eutrophication. Sewage also offers an alternative energy source. The need to plan and finance such recovery efforts is greatest in “low- and middle-income countries, where most municipal wastewater still goes into the environment untreated,” says the study, published 27 January in Natural Resources Forum. ### Conservation A decision by South Africa's government to allow breeding and genetic research on more than 30 wild species—including rhinos, lions, and cheetahs—could considerably reduce their genetic diversity, scientists warned last week. The government's action has been interpreted to allow breeders to select for commercially desirable traits, such as longer horns or larger body size; that could create genetic bottlenecks by promoting a few stud lines, the researchers wrote in the South African Journal of Science. They added that it may prove expensive or impossible to keep the intensively bred animals from mating with wild counterparts. A handful of game ranchers requested the policy, which South Africa announced in May 2019 without consulting the public or studying potential consequences. Game ranching —for hunting, meat, and tourism—already occupies more than 15% of the country, and the government wants to expand the industry. ### Funding The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) announced this week seven winners in its contest for “big ideas” to address societal problems. Four winning teams will receive $26,000 each to develop ideas on topics ranging from using artificial intelligence for complex problem-solving to developing small-scale technologies that sequester carbon dioxide. Three more teams earned $10,000 as runners-up. The 2026 Idea Machine contest attracted almost 800 submissions, and although some high schoolers made it to the semifinals, all the winners work at research institutions. NSF hopes to fund workshops and exploratory grants to further develop these and other ideas from contestants. ### Publishing A software company said last week it has teamed up with publishing giant Wiley to roll out in mid-2020 a tool that can signal whether findings in Wiley's scientific papers are reproducible. The software, called [Scite.ai][3], uses artificial intelligence to examine articles that cite a paper, and determines and displays whether they provide evidence supporting or contradicting the paper's findings. Users can browse and search the relevant text of the citing articles. Scite CEO Josh Nicholson says the software allows users to home in on articles that attempted to reproduce a study; of every 100 citations analyzed, Scite has found that 94 merely note the paper cited. The addition of Wiley's articles will expand Scite's current trove of more than 14 million papers from other publishers, most in the biomedical sciences. Nicholson expects his company to sign agreements with additional publishers to analyze their articles. ### Biomedicine The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) said this week it will award $13.5 million to 30 patient advocacy groups to support their work finding treatments for rare diseases. Of an estimated 7000 rare diseases, fewer than 5% have treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Each group will receive $450,000 over 2 years as well as training and mentoring as part of the foundation's Rare As One Project, launched last year to help advocates develop networks of patients, clinicians, and scientists. Most of the diseases are autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and other inherited disorders, but the list of diseases also includes rare cancers. CZI, founded by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan, his wife, has made a few other awards to rare disease groups. The initiative expected to make just 10 Rare As One awards but tripled the number after receiving 275 applications. ### Conservation The Trump administration proposed last week to end penalties on owners of open oil storage ponds and other industrial operations that kill birds accidentally. The administration will instead encourage voluntary efforts to protect birds. Conservation groups cried foul, saying the change to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 will only embolden companies to take actions that threaten vulnerable species. ### BRAIN Initiative gets leader Since its launch in 2013, the U.S. Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative has doled out about $1.3 billion to develop tools that map and manipulate the brain. Until now, the multiagency effort has had no formal director. But last week, neurobiologist John Ngai of the University of California, Berkeley, was named to take the helm in March. (A longer version of the interview is at <https://scim.ag/BRAINdirector>.) > Q: Why is BRAIN getting a director? > A:The initiative has been run day to day by a terrific team of senior program directors and staff with oversight from the 10 [U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)] institutes and centers that are involved in BRAIN. I think as enterprises emerge from their startup phase, the question is how do you translate this into a sustainable enterprise, and yet maintain this cutting-edge innovation? … The initiative really will benefit from somebody thinking about this 24/7. > Q: What distinguishes this second phase of BRAIN? > A:In the first phase, there was a very intentional and concentrated focus on tool development. As we learn more about how neural circuits drive behavior … we can start implementing that knowledge, in terms of treating human diseases. I am hopeful that BRAIN, with other efforts in NIH and in partnership with industry, [can create] technology platforms that could be applied across multiple disease applications. For example: a toolkit of different types of viral delivery vectors [for gene therapy] that could be applied to different parts of the brain, different cell types in the brain, and so on. > Q: What do you see as the initiative's shortcomings? > A:We have a lot of figuring out to do in terms of how to balance the unique potential of individual investigator-initiated research versus the power of large-scale projects. … [And] there is a diversity issue in terms of ethnic diversity as well as gender diversity [among applicants and funded investigators]. It's a hard problem. It just kills me that we're leaving all this talent on the table.

"Kupferschmidt, Kai; Cohen, Jon","Will novel virus go pandemic or be contained?","The repatriation of 565 Japanese citizens from Wuhan, China, in late January offered scientists an unexpected opportunity to learn a bit more about the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) raging in that city. To avoid domestic spread of the virus, Japanese officials screened every passenger for disease symptoms and tested them for the virus after they landed. Eight tested positive, but four of those had no symptoms at all, says epidemiologist Hiroshi Nishiura of Hokkaido University, Sapporo—which is a bright red flag for epidemiologists who are trying to figure out what the fast-moving epidemic has in store for humanity. If many infections go unnoticed, as the Japanese finding suggests, that vastly complicates efforts to contain the outbreak. Two months after 2019-nCoV emerged—and with well over 20,000 cases and 427 deaths as Science went to press—mathematical modelers have been racing to predict where the virus will move next, how big a toll it might ultimately take, and whether isolating patients and limiting travel will slow it. But to make confident predictions, they need to know much more about how easily the virus spreads, how sick it makes people, and whether infected people with no symptoms can still infect others. Some of that information is coming out of China. But amid the all-out battle to control the virus, and with diagnostic capabilities in short supply, Chinese researchers cannot answer all the questions. Countries with just a handful of cases, such as Japan, can also reveal important data, says Preben Aavitsland of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. “It's up to all countries now that receive cases to collect as much information as possible.” With the limited information so far, scientists are sketching out possible paths that the virus might take, weighing the likelihoods of each, and trying to determine the fallout. “We're at this stage where defined scenarios and the evidence for and against them are really important because it allows people to plan better,” says Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. These scenarios break into two broad categories: The world gets the virus under control—or it doesn't. The most optimistic scenario is one in which 2019-nCoV remains mostly confined to China, where 99% of the confirmed cases have occurred so far. (By 4 February, two dozen other countries had together reported 195 cases.) “There has obviously been a huge amount of spread within China, but [elsewhere], there's no evidence of any kind of substantial human-to-human transmission,” says Robin Thompson, a mathematical epidemiologist at the University of Oxford. “The risk probably isn't as high as some models have been projecting.” If no other countries see sustained transmission and the quarantines and other measures taken in China start to reduce the number of infections there, the risk of spread might gradually go down, and the virus might eventually be quashed. This happened with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which ended after fewer than 9000 cases. That's what the World Health Organization (WHO), which last week declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, hopes for this time. In a press conference, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a global version of the approach his team took in the current Ebola outbreak: Fight the disease at the source and try to keep it from gaining a foothold elsewhere. “Focus on the epicenter,” Tedros said. “If you have several epicenters, it is chaos.” Epidemiologist Marion Koopmans of Erasmus Medical Center says it may not be that hard to contain the virus in a new locale as long as the first cases are detected and isolated early—provided the virus is not highly transmissible. “We don't see it taking off in the 200 or so cases seeded outside of China,” Koopmans says. If that pattern holds, “there still is the possibility it will bend off.” She and others suspect the climate may help. Influenza typically only spreads during the winter months and hits northern and southern China at different times. If that is true for 2019-nCoV, its spread might start to slow down in the Northern Hemisphere within a few months. “That is a big question mark we're trying to assess at the moment,” says Joseph Wu, a modeler at the University of Hong Kong. But is containment realistic? Success will depend in part on whether infected people who don't have symptoms can spread the virus. Asymptomatic people are hard to find and isolate, so if they can spread disease, 2019-nCoV “will be very difficult to stop in China,” says Alessandro Vespignani, a modeler of infectious diseases at Northeastern University. But if asymptomatic transmission is rare, he says, “isolation and social distancing can have a big impact.” So far it has been difficult to get a handle on this question. Some data from China seem to support asymptomatic transmission, but none are clear-cut. A widely reported 30 January letter in The New England Journal of Medicine described the case of a Chinese businesswoman who touched off a cluster of four cases in Germany before she became sick herself. But 4 days later, it became clear the researchers had not contacted the woman, who had flown back to China, before the paper was published. In a later phone interview, she said she had experienced some symptoms while in Germany. In follow-up results announced in a 4 February press release, the researchers noted that some patients they studied shed virus even though their symptoms were mild. That's almost as bad as asymptomatic transmission, says virologist Christian Drosten of the Charité University Hospital in Berlin: Patients with mild symptoms are unlikely to seek medical care and may not even stay home, giving the virus ample opportunities to spread far and wide. Based on what they have seen so far, many researchers think it's probably too late to contain the virus. “As the virus continues to spread in China, the risk of exportation to other countries grows and sooner or later we will see it spread in another country,” Aavitsland says. So far there has been no sustained transmission outside of China, but Lipsitch expects that to change: “I would be really shocked if in 2 or 3 weeks there wasn't ongoing transmission with hundreds of cases in several countries on several continents.” If the virus does spread to all corners of the world in a pandemic, several questions will loom large: What percentage of the population will become infected, and of those, how many will get very sick or die? More severe cases place heavier demands on health care systems—hospitals in Wuhan are already overwhelmed—and result in greater fears and disruption of daily life. A deadly pandemic might force the world to make stark choices about fair access to medicines or vaccines, if they become available. It might also lead to widespread restrictions on domestic travel akin to those already in force in China, Aavitsland says. If, on the other hand, 2019-nCoV resembles the common cold or a mild flu, the spread of the virus would be less alarming. Existing travel bans likely would be lifted. Understanding the severity and case fatality rate is a challenge with any new pathogen. When a new influenza strain emerged in 2009—and went on to cause a pandemic—many worried it might turn out to be a nasty variety. It took months to establish that the new virus killed only about one in 10,000 patients. So far, mortality among known 2019-nCoV cases is about 2%, and some reports say 20% of infected people suffer severe disease. But these figures may overlook tens of thousands of people with mild disease—say, a sore throat or a low-grade fever—who never seek medical care and may not even know they were infected with 2019-nCoV. Many may have no symptoms at all. “So what looks like a horrific disease may be the horrific tip of a very large iceberg,” Lipsitch says. The fact that four Japanese evacuees were asymptomatic is a case in point. Studies in China have also reported some cases with few or no symptoms. What's missing is a large study in China, Lipsitch says. He suggests some fraction of the tests that are available in a place with many cases should be set aside for that purpose. (Current recommendations in China call for testing people with clear symptoms only.) If indeed 2019-nCoV becomes pandemic, humanity may be stuck with it indefinitely. After spreading far and wide, the virus might become endemic in the human population, just like four other coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and occasionally cause fresh outbreaks. How much death and disease it would cause is anyone's guess. The silver lining of the epidemic is that scientists have collected and shared information at record speed. “Every day that goes by we know more and every day that goes by we can do better modeling,” Vespignani says. “Unfortunately, this beast is moving very fast.”","","False","Science","565|Japanese|Wuhan|China|late January|2019-nCoV|Japanese|Eight|four|Hiroshi Nishiura|Hokkaido University|Japanese|Two months after|2019-nCoV|well over 20,000|427|Science|China|Chinese|Japan|Preben Aavitsland|the Norwegian Institute of Public Health|Marc Lipsitch|the Harvard T.H.

The rapid spread of covid-19, and the fact that healthcare facilities could be sources of contagion, has focused attention on new models of care that avoid face-to-face contact between clinician and patient. There has been particular interest in video consultations, which are already being rolled out in many countries as part of national digital health strategies.123 How appropriate are video consultations for dealing with the coronavirus crisis—and what are the challenges of scaling up this model at speed? Randomised trials (most of which were underpowered) have shown that clinical consultations conducted through a video link tend to be associated with high satisfaction among patients and staff; no difference in disease progression; no substantial difference in service use; and lower transaction costs compared with traditional clinic based care.4567 However, almost all this evidence pertains to highly selected samples of hospital outpatients with chronic, stable conditions and is largely irrelevant to the current escalating situation involving patients with an acute and potentially serious illness. Organisational case studies have shown that introducing video consultations is a complex change that disrupts long established processes and routines.891011 Some …","","False","BMJ","covid-19","unk","#7708","","","ORG","WHO","2020-03-12","","10.1136/bmj.m998",""

DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. SETTING: Nationwide general population in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. RESULTS: Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72-2.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19-3.11; 95 CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55-5.41; 95 CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. There is a need for further efforts to understand the mechanism regarding the general public's risk perception for eﬀective risk communication.","","False","BMJ Open","Middle East|2015|South Korea|four|South Korea|4010|19 years|CoV|1|2|3|Multivariate|CoV|OR|1.72|95%|CI|1.14|2.86|2.19|95|CI|1.44|4.67|3.55|95|CI|1.44|9.01|CoV","unk","#5559","","32139484","LOC|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON","WHO","2020-03-01","","10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033026",""

Purpose To investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging coronavirus 2019-nCoV pneumonia in humans. Materials and Methods Fifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women, 16-76 years old) with 2019-nCoV pneumonia confirmed with the positive new coronavirus nucleic acid antibody underwent thin-section CT. The imaging findings, clinical and laboratory data were evaluated. Results Fifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of the endemic center Wuhan contact. Fever (49/51, 96%) and cough (24/51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37/51, 73%), neutrophil count (44/51, 86.3%) and normal (17/51, 35.3%) or reduced (33/51, 64.7%) lymphocyte count.

Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more. Results Of 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans.

Purpose To assess the performance of United States (U.S.) and Chinese radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT. Methods A total of 219 patients with both positive COVID-19 by RT-PCR and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 7 Chinese hospitals in Hunan Providence, China from January 6 to February 20, 2020. A total of 205 patients with positive Respiratory Pathogen Panel for viral pneumonia and CT findings consistent with or highly suspicious for pneumonia by original radiology interpretation within 7 days of each other were identified from Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI. Three Chinese radiologists blindly reviewed all chest CTs (n=424) to differentiate COVID-19 from viral pneumonia. A sample of 58 age-matched cases was randomly selected and evaluated by 4 U.S. radiologists in a similar fashion. Different CT features were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results For all chest CTs, three Chinese radiologists correctly differentiated COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia 83% (350/424), 80% (338/424), and 60% (255/424) of the time, respectively.

This study investigated the level of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and turnover intention, the relationship between PTSD and turnover intention, and the buffering effect of supervisor support among nurses post-MERS outbreak. Methods: In total, 300 nurses from three of 15 isolation hospitals in South Korea were invited to participate. We collected data pertaining to PTSD, turnover intention, supervisor support, work-related factors, and socio-demographic factors through a structured survey distributed to the nurses at the hospitals after the outbreak. For the statistical analyses, descriptive statistics and multiple regression were employed. Findings: Of the 147 participants, 33.3% were involved in the direct care of the infected patients, whereas 66.7% were involved in the direct care of the suspected patients. More than half (57.1%) of the nurses experienced PTSD, with 25.1% experienced full PTSD and 32.0% with moderate or some level of PTSD. The mean score of turnover intention was 16.3, with the score range of 4 to 20. The multiple regression analysis revealed that PTSD was positively associated with turnover intention, and supervisor support had a strong buffering effect. Conclusion/Application to Practice: These findings confirmed that after a fatal infectious disease outbreak like MERS, nurses experience high level of PTSD and show high intention to leave.

How these diverse receptor recognition patterns affect viral entry is unknown. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is the only known coronavirus that uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike to recognize a protein receptor, CEACAM1a. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of MHV spike complexed with mouse CEACAM1a. The trimeric spike contains three receptor-binding S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. Three receptor molecules bind to the sides of the spike trimer, where three NTDs are located. Receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike, weakening the interactions between S1 and S2. Using protease sensitivity and negative-stain EM analyses, we further showed that after protease treatment of the spike, receptor binding facilitated the dissociation of S1 from S2, allowing S2 to transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation. Together these results reveal a new role of receptor binding in MHV entry: in addition to its well-characterized role in viral attachment to host cells, receptor binding also induces the conformational change of the spike and hence the fusion of viral and host membranes. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into coronavirus entry and highlights the diverse entry mechanisms used by different viruses.","","False","PLOS Pathogens","NTD|CEACAM1a|CEACAM1a|three|S1|Three|three|S1","unk","#5756","","32150576","ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","WHO","2020-03-09","","10.1371/journal.ppat.1008392",""

Methods In our study, 94 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We prospectively collect blood coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the same period. Results Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the control group (p < 0.001). The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB) in all SARS-CoV-2 cases were substantially higher than those in healthy controls. Moreover, D-dimer and FDP values in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher than those in patients with milder forms. Compared with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity (PT-act) was lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thrombin time in critical SARS-CoV-2 patients was also shorter than that in controls.

As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.","","False","Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (CCLM)","2019|COVID-19|2|RT-PCR|CT|RT-PCR|RT-PCR|RT","unk","#8733","","","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG|ORG","WHO","2020-03-16","","10.1515/cclm-2020-0285",""

As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936 reported cases in mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland China (1). There have been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been reported in the United States. Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United States, and an additional 39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from high-risk settings, for a current total of 53 cases within the United States. This report summarizes the aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners are implementing to slow and try to contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States.

The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. The CT features of COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This study included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients. The CT images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19. The The "reversed halo" sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign are uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. CONCLUSION. We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients. However, CT is still limited for identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between viruses.","","False","American Journal of Roentgenology","2019|COVID-19|CT|COVID-19|CT|CT|METHODS|first|51|23|28|26-83 years|two|one|one|58|66 years|CT|53|CT|99|CT|CT|CT|CT|COVID-19|CT|two|COVID-19|CT|49|COVID-19|two|CT|CT|CT|COVID-19|CT|CT|COVID-19|CT|COVID-19|3.9%|2/51|COVID-19|CT","unk","#4517","","32130038","DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|NORP|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","WHO","2020-03-04","3006643024","10.2214/AJR.20.22954",""

Confronting the new coronavirus infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging and requires excluding patients with suspected COVID-19 who actually have other diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was observed (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean (± SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40 ± 2.00 and 5.52 ± 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05). The median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5 affected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive results, centrilobular nodules were less frequently seen in patients with positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed GGO, or consolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first week of illness were considered findings highly suspicious of COVID-19.","","False","American Journal of Roentgenology","2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|CT|COVID-19|Shanghai|China|MATERIALS|METHODS|January 19 through February 6, 2020|RT-PCR|Eleven|RT-PCR|2|22|0.05|0.05|4.40 ± 2.00|5.52 ±|4.00 days|RT-PCR|100.0%|90.9%|GGO|63.6%|72.7%|54.5%|77.3%|RT-PCR|100.0%|100.0%|31.8%|0.05|RT-PCR|RT-PCR|five|15 vs nine|0.05|COVID-19|GGO|GGO|GGO|CT|the first week|COVID-19","unk","#8808","","","DATE|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|MONEY|MONEY|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG","WHO","2020-03-14","","10.2214/AJR.20.22959",""

The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [+/- SD] age, 52.8 +/- 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score for the upper zone (3.0 +/- 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 +/- 3.8) and lower (4.5 +/- 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 +/- 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 +/- 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (</= 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT signs of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area. A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were the most common laboratory findings.","","False","American Journal of Roentgenology","62|Wuhan|China|CT|METHODS|62|COVID-19|Two|CT|CT|CT|CT|62|39|23|52.8|12.2 years|30-77 years|COVID-19|Twenty-four|30|80.0%|27|18|66.7%|27|100.0%|CT|52|62|83.9%|Forty-eight|62|77.4%|CT|3.0 +/-|3.4|4.5|3.8|4.5 +|0.022|0.020|CT|1.00|CT|4.4 +|4.1|7.7|6.3|0.003|CT|25|40.3%|GGO|21|33.9%|39|62.9%|GGO|34|54.8%|28|45.2%|35|56.5%|21|33.9%|33|53.2%|CT|45|72.6%|11|17.7%|CT|30|48.4%|35|56.5%|six|9.7%|7 days|8-14 days|GGO|GGO|COVID-19|Identification|GGO|CT","unk","#5523","","32134681","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|NORP|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|NORP","WHO","2020-03-05","3006354146","10.2214/ajr.20.22975",""

The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion.

Available information on CT features of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is scattered in different publications, and a cohesive literature review has yet to be compiled. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This article includes a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization database. RESULTS. Known features of COVID-19 on initial CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification (GGO) with a peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes and less frequently within the right middle lobe. Atypical initial imaging presentation of consolidative opacities superimposed on GGO may be found in a smaller number of cases, mainly in the elderly population. Septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and subpleural involvement are some of the less common findings, mainly in the later stages of the disease. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation, CT halo sign, and pneumothorax are uncommon but may be seen with disease progression. Follow-up CT in the intermediate stage of disease shows an increase in the number and size of GGOs and progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidative opacities, septal thickening, and development of a crazy paving pattern, with the greatest severity of CT findings visible around day 10 after the symptom onset. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most common indication for transferring patients with COVID-19 to the ICU and the major cause of death in this patient population. Imaging patterns corresponding to clinical improvement usually occur after week 2 of the disease and include gradual resolution of consolidative opacities and decrease in the number of lesions and involved lobes.

Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough. But in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop to the acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy. The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human-to-human. Therefore, high-risk aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan. The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne PPE should be applied to the health care providers. A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance. For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided and modified rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended. Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation. For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.","","False","cmsj","Coronavirus Disease 2019|COVID-19|firstly|Wuhan|Hubei|China|December 2019|the next two months|China|COVID-19|Wuhan|Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology|PPE","unk","#3041","","32102726","ORG|DATE|ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|PERSON|GPE|ORG|ORG","WHO","2020-01-01","2017345465","10.24920/003724",""

To better understand the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, we performed computational alanine scanning mutagenesis on the “hotspot” residues at protein-protein interfaces using relative free energy calculations.

To conquer viral infections, the inhibition of proteases essential for proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy. To this date, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat SARS-CoV-2 despite its close relation to the SARS-CoV-1 virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003. Thus, there remains an urgent need for the development of specific antiviral therapeutics to conquer SARS-CoV-2. In order to find novel inhibitors, we computationally screened a compound library of over 687 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. A screening of such a vast chemical space for SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors has not been reported before. After shape screening, two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of pharmacokinetically relevant molecular descriptors to narrow down the initial hits. Next, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to validate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensively quantify ligand binding energies. After evaluation of off-target binding, we report a list of 11 drug-like compounds with improved binding free energy to the target protease in contrast to the cocrystallized peptidomimetic lead compound that suffers from poor pharmacokinetic properties. Furthermore, we identified one potent binder with comparable properties from the natural compound library.","","False","","2|China|almost 90000|thousands|2003|over 687 million|two|11|one","unk","#7330","","","CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","WHO","2020-03-03","","10.26434/CHEMRXIV.11923239.V1",""

Hower, no approved drugs have been found to effectively inhibit the virus. Since it has been reported that the HIV-1 protease inhibitors can be used as anti-SARS drugs by tegarting SARS-CoV 3CLpro, we choose six approved anti-HIV-1 drugs to investigate their binding interactions between 3CLpro, and to evaluate their potential to become clinical drugs for the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The molecular docking results indicate that, the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher binding affinity for all the studied inhibitors than its SARS homologue. Two docking complexes (indinavir and darunavir) with high docking scores were futher subjected to MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations to detail the molecular interactions between these two proteinase inhibitors and the 3CLpro. Our results show that darunavir has the best binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 3CLpro among all inhibitors, indicating it has the potential to become an anti-COVID-19 clinical drug. The likely reason behind the increased binding affinity of HIV-1 protease inhibitors toward SARS-CoV2 3CLpro than that of SARS-CoV were investigated by MD simulations. Our study provides insight into the possible role of structural flexibility during interactions between 3CLpro and inhibitors, and sheds light on the structure-based design of anti-COVID-19 drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.","","False","","Wuhan|Hubei Province|China|Hower|HIV-1|six|3CLpro|Two|MM|two|HIV-1|CoV|MD|3CLpro","unk","#7276","","","GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL","WHO","2020-03-05","","10.26434/CHEMRXIV.11932995.V1",""

Unfortunately, we still have no pharmaceutical weapons against the diseases caused by these viruses. The pandemic of 2019-nCoV reminds us of the urgency to search new drugs with totally different mechanism that may target the weaknesses specific to coronaviruses. Herein, we disclose a new targeted oxidation strategy (TOS II) leveraging non-covalent interactions potentially to oxidize and inhibit the activities of cytosolic thiol proteins via thiol/thiolate oxidation to disulfide (TOD). Quantum mechanical calculations show encouraging results supporting the feasibility to selectively oxidize thiol of targeted proteins via TOS II even in relatively reducing cytosolic microenvironments. Molecular docking against the two thiol proteases Mpro and PLpro of 2019-nCoV provide evidence to support a TOS II mechanism for two experimentally identified anti-2019-nCoV disulfide oxidants: disulfiram and PX-12. Remarkably, disulfiram is an anti-alcoholism drug approved by FDA 70 years ago, thus it can be immediately used in phase III clinical trial for anti-2019-nCoV treatment.

Therefore, it was necessary to rapidly implement adequately quick and sensitive diagnostic assays for outbreak management of SARS-CoV-2 in public health laboratories. As soon as the World Health Organization (WHO) published the first protocols for real-time RT-PCR assays, the Bavarian Food and Health Authority started to implement them. We ordered control material and oligonucleotides (see details below) in week 4 and ran our first SARS-CoV-2 assays on 27 January (week 5). On the same day, the first German case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was diagnosed in Bavaria [1]. In the following days, health authorities implemented comprehensive measures to prevent further transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including testing of contact persons. We initially used the protocol based on the E gene and RdRp gene developed by the German Consiliary Laboratory for Coronaviruses hosted at the Charité in Berlin [5]. Real-time RT-PCR was initially performed with the QuantiTect Virus +Rox Vial kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) on the Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Feldkirchen, Germany). The kit was chosen for its frequent and successful use in our laboratory with other assays and its immediate availability. Primers and probes were used as described [5] and provided by TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). Control material was ordered from the European Virus Archive (EVAg) and consisted of synthetic Wuhan coronavirus 2019 E gene control (reference number 026N-03866) and SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 RNA (reference number 004N-02005) [6]. In addition, the control of LightMix Modular Wuhan CoV RdRP-gene (TibMolbiol, Berlin, Germany) was used for the SARS-CoV-2 specific assay. Respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum) were obtained from patients and contact persons. Sputum samples were diluted in 2 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS). RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Bio Robot kit (QIAGEN) on a Hamilton Microlab Star (Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland). As at 1 March, 87,024 cases and 2,979 associated deaths have been reported worldwide [1]. The vast majority of the deaths (96%) have been reported in China [1]. Despite the high number of cases reported globally, estimates of the severity pyramid of disease and case fatality rate remain very uncertain; one large study conducted in China estimated that the majority (81%) of the cases were mild (i.e. non-pneumonia or mild pneumonia), 14% were severe (e.g. with dyspnoea) and 5% were in a critical condition (i.e. respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure) [2]. The case fatality ratio was 2.3% [2]. Despite extraordinary containment measures implemented in China, including the enforced lockdown of several cities and closures of schools, the virus has spread throughout the country and internationally [2].

Our estimates of the risk for death in Wuhan reached values as high as 12% in the epicenter of the epidemic and ≈1% in other, more mildly affected areas.

The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002&ndash;2003 epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases. Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their transmissibility.

The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf contains chemical components such as &beta;-sitosterol, indirubin, tryptanthrin, betulin, indigodole A, and indigodole B that have diverse biological activities. However, the antiviral action of S. cusia leaf and its components against human coronavirus remains to be elucidated. Human coronavirus NL63 infection is frequent among immunocompromised individuals, young children, and in the elderly. This study investigated the anti-Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) activity of the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf and its major components. The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf effectively inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) and virus yield (IC50 = 0.64 &mu;g/mL) in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. Moreover, this extract potently inhibited the HCoV-NL63 infection in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the six components identified in the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf, tryptanthrin and indigodole B (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin) exhibited potent antiviral activity in reducing the CPE and progeny virus production. The IC50 values against virus yield were 1.52 &mu;M and 2.60 &mu;M for tryptanthrin and indigodole B, respectively. Different modes of time-of-addition/removal assay indicated that tryptanthrin prevented the early and late stages of HCoV-NL63 replication, particularly by blocking viral RNA genome synthesis and papain-like protease 2 activity. Notably, tryptanthrin (IC50 = 0.06 &mu;M) and indigodole B (IC50 = 2.09 &mu;M) exhibited strong virucidal activity as well.

We found that the distribution of Wuhan&rsquo;s migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan&rsquo;s migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhan&rsquo;s total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhan&rsquo;s migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged and high-risk individuals. Their social characteristics include nuclear family migration (84%), migration with families of 3&ndash;4 members (71%), a rural household registration (85%), and working or doing business (84%) as the main reason for migration. Using a quasi-experimental analysis framework, we found that the size of Wuhan&rsquo;s migrants was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed cases.

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20&ndash;24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","","False","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","2019|China|COVID-19|31 January to 2 February 2020|the past 14 days|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|the Impact of Event Scale-Revised|Depression|Anxiety|DASS-21|1210|194|China|53.8%|16.5%|28.8%|8.1%|20&ndash;24|84.7%|COVID-19|75.2%|75.1%|0.05|0.05|COVID-19|China|more than half|about one-third|COVID-19","unk","#5504","","","DATE|GPE|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|EVENT|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","WHO","2020-03-06","1994584686","10.3390/ijerph17051729",""

In order to control the spread of an epidemic, the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance. However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a case study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the time of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. Among other insights, the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be an effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, but the location selection of these temporary incinerators is of significant importance. Due to the limitation on available data and knowledge at present stage, more real-world information are needed to assess the effectiveness of the current solution.","","False","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|COVID-19|Wuhan","unk","#5779","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE","WHO","2020-03-09","","10.3390/ijerph17051770",""

We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies.

Lactogenic immunity induced via the gut-mammary gland-secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, remains the most promising and effective way to protect suckling piglets from PEDV. Therefore, a successful PEDV vaccine must induce protective maternal IgA antibodies that passively transfer into colostrum and milk. Identifying variables that influence lymphocyte migration and IgA secretion during gestation and lactation is imperative for designing maternal immunization strategies that generate the highest amount of lactogenic immune protection against PEDV in suckling piglets. Because pregnancy-associated immune alterations influence viral pathogenesis and adaptive immune responses in many different species, a better understanding of host immune responses to PEDV in pregnant swine may translate into improved maternal immunization strategies against enteric pathogens for multiple species.

In this sense, the objective of the present article was to review studies on the role of wild animals as reservoirs and/or dispersers of etiological agents of human infectious diseases in order to compile data on the main wild animals and etiological agents involved in zoonotic outbreaks. A systematic review was carried out using PRISMA guidelines, using the PubMed, Scopus and SciELO platforms as data banks. The descriptors used were “zoonosis”, “human infectious diseases” and “wild animals”. The results show that wild animals (mainly bats, birds and primates) play an important role in the dissemination of etiological agents (mainly viruses, as a new coronavirus called 2019 Novel Coronavirus) in extensive geographic regions. Moreover, these wild animal organisms can act as the site for essential biotic synergy among several pathogenic microorganisms, promoting a higher rate of adaptation, mutation and even genetic recombination, with consequent stimulation of new strains and subtypes, inducing new infectious agents with unknown virulent potential. In conclusion, the monitoring of these diseases and adequate preparation for possible epidemics and pandemics are fundamental conditions for the mitigation of their future impact. The zoonotic threat of these etiological agents and the impact on public health can be enormous as shown by the ongoing epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV) infections.","","False","Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine","PRISMA|PubMed|Scopus|2019|Novel Coronavirus|2019|2019-","unk","#2543","","","ORG|ORG|PERSON|DATE|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL","WHO","2020-01-01","3004810054","10.4103/1995-7645.277535",""

However, 5,298 more patient were confirmed until 4-Mar. The purpose is to estimate and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures using mathematical modeling. METHODS: Deterministic mathematical model(SEIHR) has been established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of confirmed patients in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province(Daegu/NGP), the main area of outbreak, were used. The first patient's symptom onset date was assumed on 22-Jan. We estimate the reproduction number(R), and the effect of preventive measures, assuming that the effect has been shown from 29-Feb. or 5-Mar. RESULTS: The estimated R in Hubei Province was 4.2655, while the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.5555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.4721 and 3.5428. When the transmission period decreases from 4 days to 2 days, the outbreak finished early, but the peak of the epidemic has increased, and the total number of patients has not changed much. If transmission rate decreases about 90% or 99%, the outbreak finished early, and the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreased. CONCLUSION: To early end of the COVID-19 epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus such as social distancing and mask wearing are absolutely crucial with the participation of the public, along with the policy of reducing the transmission period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as possible through efforts by the quarantine authorities.","","False","Epidemiology and Health","first|20-Jan|about 30|Korea|17-Feb|5,298|4-Mar|Deterministic|model(SEIHR|Korean|Daegu|North Gyeongsang|first|22-Jan|29-Feb|5-Mar|Hubei Province|4.2655|Korea|0.5555|Daegu/NGP|3.4721|3.5428|4 days|2 days|about 90% or 99%|COVID-19","unk","#7648","","","ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|PERSON|NORP|ORG|LOC|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|ORG","WHO","2020-03-12","","10.4178/epih.e2020011",""

The outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","","False","Swiss Medical Weekly","first|Wuhan|China|December 2019|more than 100,000|4000|10 March 2020|WHO|Mar 11, 2020|four|229E|HKU1|OC43|early 2020|the Northern Hemisphere|winter 2020/2021|seasonal|Seasonal|seasonal","unk","#8708","","","ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|LOC|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE","WHO","2020-03-16","","10.4414/smw.2020.20224",""

This is one of the major factors affecting the progress of epidemic prevention and control. Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to quickly respond to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and it has clarified requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the emergency reserve supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and there are also deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency medical supplies. A sound system of emergency reserve supplies is crucial to the management of public health emergencies.

The first cases were noted as a cluster of patients with pneumonia who were all linked to a live animal market, and testing found the presence of a previously unknown coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that affect both animals and humans, and several (OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63) are a cause of the common cold.1, 2 However, two coronaviruses have previously caused significant outbreaks associated with more severe disease: the SARS coronavirus in 2002–2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus that emerged in 2012.1, 2 Chinese authorities and researchers should be commended for their rapid sharing of viral sequences which enabled laboratories worldwide to develop diagnostic tests within weeks of discovery of the pathogen.3 An Australian laboratory subsequently isolated the virus from a clinical sample (the first to do so outside of China), and rapidly shared this virus with relevant global agencies, further aiding diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine development efforts. Information on the new virus and its impact is being updated constantly. We know that SARS‐CoV‐2 can cause severe disease, although active surveillance of contacts is required to define the milder end of the disease spectrum and to estimate the true hospitalisation and case fatality ratio. The cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults; it is currently unclear whether comorbidities reflect the age group affected or whether they are risk factors for severe disease.4, 5 Early studies using data before the institution of public health interventions in China suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 is as transmissible as SARS coronavirus and probably more transmissible than influenza viruses.6, 7 The timing of infectiousness relative to symptom onset is a particularly important parameter with implications for public health control. While reports suggest that asymptomatic infection and transmission may result from minimally symptomatic cases, the contribution of this to transmission is not yet known.8 Careful analysis of early data suggests that the mean incubation period is 6 days, with a range of up to 14 days.9 Reports of large outbreaks, particularly associated with hospitals and closed communities, raise the possibility of “superspreading” events, a feature of previous coronavirus outbreaks.10 The importance of infection control is also reinforced by a report that 41% of cases in Wuhan were acquired nosocomially (including 40 health care workers and 17 patients).4 As at 26 February 2020, there were 23 confirmed cases of COVID‐19 in Australia, across five jurisdictions. Although reported case numbers in China are slowing, large outbreaks on a cruise ship in Japan, and in South Korea, Iran and Italy are concerning and highlight our interconnected world. However, it is likely that this will change in the days or weeks ahead. Although absolute case numbers are small in Australia, the public health, political and societal ramifications have already been considerable, ranging from travel restrictions on non‐Australians coming from China, the use of offshore and remote quarantine facilities, and disturbing reports of racism against members of our Asian community (https://insig​htplus.mja.com.au/2020/5/coron​avirus-no-place-for-racism-xenop​hobia/).","","False","Medical Journal of Australia","2|SARS‐CoV‐2|2019|COVID‐19|Wuhan|Hubei|China|December 2019|first|229E|HKU1|2|two|2002–2003|Middle East|2012.1|2|Chinese|weeks|Australian|first|China|SARS‐CoV‐2|5|China|SARS‐CoV‐2|6 days|up to 14|41%|Wuhan|40|17|26 February 2020|23|COVID‐19|Australia|five|China|Japan|South Korea|Iran|Italy|the days or weeks ahead|Australia|China|Asian","unk","#5128","","","CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|LOC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|DATE|NORP|ORDINAL|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|NORP","WHO","2020-03-08","","10.5694/mja2.50530",""

There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. DESIGN: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. SETTING: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. PARTICIPANTS: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. MEASUREMENTS: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. RESULTS: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. LIMITATION: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. CONCLUSION: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecasting model for the highest possible accuracy. In this paper, a methodology that embraces these three virtues of data mining from a small dataset is proposed. An experiment that is based on the recent coronavirus outbreak originated from Wuhan is conducted by applying this methodology. It is shown that an optimized forecasting model that is constructed from a new algorithm, namely polynomial neural network with corrective feedback (PNN+cf) is able to make a forecast that has relatively the lowest prediction error. The results showcase that the newly proposed methodology and PNN+cf are useful in generating acceptable forecast upon the critical time of disease outbreak when the samples are far from abundant.","","False","International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence","three|1|2|3|three|Wuhan|PNN+cf|PNN+cf","unk","#3177","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|ORG","WHO","2020-01-01","3004754245","10.9781/ijimai.2020.02.002",""

OBJECTIVE: To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; ≥50 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study support having high targets for 2-dose measles vaccine coverage, particularly among school-aged children in the United States.","8ad769c159358842b5ccacbd383987335844ad86","True","JAMA Pediatr","the United States|the United States|January 1, 2001,|December 31, 2017|the United States|US|Transmissibility|MAIN OUTCOMES|2218|1025|1176|17|age,|15 years|0-89 years|2001 to 2017|0.76|95%|CI|0.71|1|0.17|95%|CI|0.11-0.26|2|0.27|95%|CI|0.17|0.52|95%|CI|0.44|1957|0.35|95%|CI|0.20-0.58|1957|0.64|95%|CI|0.61|5 to 17 years|0.36|95%|CI|0.31|1 year|0.14|95%|CI|0.10|1-4 years|0.25|95%|CI|0.20|18-29 years|0.19|95%|CI|0.15-0.24|30-49 years|0.15|95%|CI|0.11|≥50 years|0.04|95%|CI|0.01-0.10|the United States","cc-by","","PMC6865326","31738391","GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE","PMC","2020 Jan 18","","10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.4357","comm_use_subset"

No data exist on the interaction of local immune responses in rhinovirus infection. Therefore, we aimed to determine the tonsillar immune responses according to rhinovirus A, B and C infections. METHODS: We collected tonsillar samples, nasopharyngeal aspirates and peripheral blood from 42 rhinovirus positive tonsillectomy patients. Fifteen respiratory viruses or their types were investigated from nasopharynx and tonsil tissue, and rhinovirus species were typed. The expression of 10 cytokines and 4 transcription factors (IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-28, IL-29, IL-37, TGF-β, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2 and Tbet) were studied from tonsil tissue by quantitative PCR. A standard questionnaire of respiratory symptoms and health was filled by the patient or his/her guardian. The patients were divided into three groups by the determination of rhinovirus species. RESULTS: Overall, 16 patients had rhinovirus A, 12 rhinovirus B and 14 rhinovirus C infection. In rhinovirus B positive group there were significantly less men (P = 0.0072), less operated in spring (P = 0.0096) and more operated in fall (P = 0.030) than in rhinovirus A or C groups. Rhinovirus A positive patients had more respiratory symptoms (P = 0.0074) and particularly rhinitis (P = 0.036) on the operation day. There were no significant differences between the groups in virus codetection. In adjusted analysis, rhinovirus C infections were associated with increased IFN-α (P = 0.045) and decreased RORC2 expression (P = 0.025).

"Herrera-Diestra, José L.; Meyers, Lauren Ancel","Local risk perception enhances epidemic control","As infectious disease outbreaks emerge, public health agencies often enact vaccination and social distancing measures to slow transmission. Their success depends on not only strategies and resources, but also public adherence. Individual willingness to take precautions may be influenced by global factors, such as news media, or local factors, such as infected family members or friends. Here, we compare three modes of epidemiological decision-making in the midst of a growing outbreak using network-based mathematical models that capture plausible heterogeneity in human contact patterns. Individuals decide whether to adopt a recommended intervention based on overall disease prevalence, the proportion of social contacts infected, or the number of social contacts infected. While all strategies can substantially mitigate transmission, vaccinating (or self isolating) based on the number of infected acquaintances is expected to prevent the most infections while requiring the fewest intervention resources. Unlike the other strategies, it has a substantial herd effect, providing indirect protection to a large fraction of the population.","23d0641f1f78528bbf3fa7b0b749abc1299a9cb4","True","PLoS One","three","cc-by","","PMC6890219","31794551","CARDINAL","PMC","2019 Dec 3","","10.1371/journal.pone.0225576","comm_use_subset"

Silver nanoparticles were synthesized, via sodium citrate and silver nitrate addition into a boiling aqueous solution of curcumin, monomers and surfactant. Curcumin and sodium citrate promoted silver nucleation, acting as reducing and stabilizing agents. These curcumin-capped AgNPs enabled, after adding the radical polymerization initiator, the assembling of the growing polymer chains around the hydrophobic AgNP surface. The resultant core-doped shell nanohybrids exhibit plasmonic, luminescent and volume thermoresponsive properties, with improved possibilities to be used as successful therapeutic platforms. In fact, the possibility to nanoconfine the synergistic antioxidant, antiviral, antibacterial features of silver and curcumin in one bioavailable hybrid paves the way to promising applications in the biomedical field.","9be8c80283a7fed59057d7788eb2850708f45450","True","Sci Rep","one|Curcumin|AgNP","cc-by","","PMC6890765","31796864","CARDINAL|PERSON|NORP","PMC","2019 Dec 3","","10.1038/s41598-019-54752-4","comm_use_subset"

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the antiviral activity of crude extracts from B. licheniformis against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a highly contagious enveloped porcine virus that has caused great economic loss in pigs. In vivo, PEDV-infected piglets supplemented with air-dried solid state fermentative cultivate containing B. licheniformis-fermented products (BLFP) showed milder clinical symptoms and decreased viral shedding. Importantly, no significant systemic pathological lesions and no reduction in average daily gain were noted in pigs supplemented with the BLFP, which suggests that it is safe for use in pigs. In vitro experiments revealed that while B. licheniformis crude extracts exhibited no toxicity in Vero cells, co-cultivation of B. licheniformis crude extracts with PEDV significantly reduced viral infection and replication. Summarized current results suggest that the B. licheniformis-fermented products could be a novel candidate food additive for reducing the impact of PED on the swine industry.","f635dd0f13ee3859c7e4b653398c9b9dba9895d8","True","AMB Express","B.|B.|B.|BLFP|daily|BLFP|B.|Vero|B.|B.|PED","cc-by","","PMC6890879","31797149","ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|NORP|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 3","","10.1186/s13568-019-0916-0","comm_use_subset"

Sia come in a variety of chemically modified forms, including those with acetyl modifications at the C-7, C-8, and C-9 positions. Here, we analyzed the distribution and amounts of these acetyl modifications in different human and canine cells. Since Sia or their variant forms are receptors for influenza A, B, C, and D viruses, we examined the effects of these modifications on virus infections. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl modified Sia are widely but variably expressed across cell lines from both humans and canines. Although they were expressed on the cell surfaces of canine MDCK cell lines, they were located primarily within the Golgi compartment of human HEK-293 and A549 cells. The O-acetyl modified Sia were expressed at low levels of 1 to 2% of total Sia in these cell lines. We knocked out and overexpressed the sialate O-acetyltransferase gene (CasD1) and knocked out the sialate O-acetylesterase gene (SIAE) using CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Knocking out CasD1 removed 7,9-O- and 9-O-acetyl Sia expression, confirming previous reports. However, overexpression of CasD1 and knockout of SIAE gave only modest increases in 9-O-acetyl levels in cells and no change in 7,9-O-acetyl levels, indicating that there are complex regulations of these modifications. These modifications were essential for influenza C and D infection but had no obvious effect on influenza A and B infection.","2448743a5de075f6a1816e46fe72b69cc791da18","True","mBio","Sia|9-O|7,9-O|MDCK|Golgi|1 to 2%|CasD1|SIAE|CRISPR/Cas9|CasD1|9-O|Sia|CasD1|SIAE|9-O","cc-by","","PMC6890989","31796537","PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","PMC","2019 Dec 3","","10.1128/mBio.02490-19","comm_use_subset"

While past publications have looked at interdisciplinary competency training for collaboration, few have identified the factors and conditions that enable operational One Health. Through a scoping review of the literature, a multidisciplinary team of researchers analyzed peer-reviewed publications describing multisectoral collaborations around infectious disease-related health events. The review identified 12 factors that support successful One Health collaborations and a coordinated response to health events across three levels: two individual factors (education & training and prior experience & existing relationships), four organizational factors (organizational structures, culture, human resources and, communication), and six network factors (network structures, relationships, leadership, management, available & accessible resources, political environment). The researchers also identified the stage of collaboration during which these factors were most critical, further organizing into starting condition or process-based factors. The research found that publications on multisectoral collaboration for health events do not uniformly report on successes or challenges of collaboration and rarely identify outputs or outcomes of the collaborative process. This paper proposes a common language and framework to enable more uniform reporting, implementation, and evaluation of future One Health collaborations.","d5d29d1d48e1a4fe8f39d38639766c86dc976e5e","True","PLoS One","One|One|12|One|three|two|four|six|One","cc-by","","PMC6892547","31800579","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","PMC","2019 Dec 4","","10.1371/journal.pone.0224660","comm_use_subset"

International air travel facilitates the spread of dengue across and within borders. To date, no predictive factors have been established for assessing risk of dengue among febrile travelers. METHODS: Since 2006, Taiwan has operated a program of infrared thermometer–based non-contact active surveillance at Taoyuan International Airport (TPE). All inbound passengers from dengue-endemic countries who are febrile (tympanic temperature ≥38°C) undergo routine laboratory testing for dengue. We analyzed clinical and epidemiological characteristics of all tested passengers entering Taiwan via TPE in 2011 to identify the predictive factors of dengue infection. RESULTS: In 2011, of the 3,719 febrile passengers from dengue-endemic countries, 74 (2.0%) had laboratory-confirmed dengue infection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that those who were aged ≥60 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6–29.6) and had self-reported fever (aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5–4.1), skin rashes (aOR, 11.0; 95% CI, 3.4–35.1), or a tympanic temperature ≥39°C (aOR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7–4.9) were significantly more likely to have dengue (all p values < 0.05). Compared with travelers who stayed in dengue-endemic countries for ≤7 days, those who traveled 8–14, 15–21, 22–28, and ≥29 days were also more likely to be infected (aORs of 10.2, 14.9, 39.0 and 12.0, respectively). CONCLUSION: These clinical and epidemiological features can facilitate timely recognition and diagnosis of imported dengue in febrile inbound passengers and therefore help prevent domestic transmission of dengue virus.","9633dd466a1f1c402c18d7db00bae7bf1eea5250","True","PLoS One","Southeast Asia|2006|Taiwan|Taoyuan International Airport|Taiwan|2011|2011|3,719|74|2.0%|≥60 years|8.7|95%|CI|2.5|95%|CI|1.5–4.1|11.0|95%|CI|3.4–35.1|2.9|95%|CI|1.7–4.9|0.05|≤7 days|8–14|15–21|22–28|days|10.2|14.9|39.0|12.0","cc-by","","PMC6894787","31805101","LOC|DATE|GPE|FAC|GPE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE","PMC","2019 Dec 5","","10.1371/journal.pone.0225840","comm_use_subset"

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) deeply characterize the genetic diversity among rapidly mutating virus populations at the interspecific as well as the intraspecific level. The diversity of RNA viruses present in faeces of neonatal piglets suffering from diarrhoea in 47 farms, plus 4 samples from non-diarrhoeic piglets has been evaluated by NGS. Samples were selected among the cases submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories of Infectious Diseases of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain) and Universidad de León (León, Spain). RESULTS: The analyses identified the presence of 12 virus species corresponding to 8 genera of RNA viruses. Most samples were co-infected by several viruses. Kobuvirus and Rotavirus were more commonly reported, with Sapovirus, Astrovirus 3, 4 and 5, Enterovirus G, Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, Pasivirus and Posavirus being less frequently detected. Most sequences showed a low identity with the sequences deposited in GenBank, allowing us to propose several new VP4 and VP7 genotypes for Rotavirus B and Rotavirus C. CONCLUSIONS: Among the cases analysed, Rotaviruses were the main aetiological agents of diarrhoea in neonate pigs. Besides, in a small number of cases Kobuvirus and Sapovirus may also have an aetiological role. Even most animals were co-infected in early life, the association with enteric disease among the other examined viruses was unclear.

However, there are no reports of changes in the microbial diversity of fecal microbiome after treatment with FMT in canine IBD cases. Moreover, little is known about the long-term efficacy and safety of FMT treatment for dogs. Herein, we present a case of canine intractable IBD treated with repeated, long-term FMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patient was a 10-year-old, neutered, male, 4-kg Toy Poodle with a prolonged history of vomiting and diarrhea. Fecal examination for pathogens was negative. Despite treatment with multiple antibacterial and antidiarrheal agents, the patient showed no improvement. Endoscopic mucus sampling diagnosed a case of lymphocytic-plasmacytic duodenitis, ie, idiopathic IBD. Eventually, we performed periodic, long-term fecal microbiota transplantation of fresh donor feces collected from a 4-year-old, 32.8-kg, neutered male Golden Retriever by rectal enema. Additionally, we performed 16S rRNA sequence analysis, before and after FMT, to evaluate the microbiome diversity. RESULTS: Fecal microbiome diversity after FMT resembled that of the healthy donor dog’s fecal microbiome, before FMT, which led us to conclude that the fecal microbiome in our patient normalized with FMT. Moreover, the clinical symptoms improved remarkably with regard to the changes in the fecal microbiome. Additionally, we noted no observable side effects during FMT treatment. CONCLUSION: This report indicates the efficacy and safety of long-term, periodic FMT for a case of canine IBD based on attenuation of clinical symptoms and changes in fecal microbiome diversity. Therefore, FMT could be chosen as a treatment option for IBD in canines in the future.","1d8d4fed8118f54a4a5db8892cc5e5bbbf19afa4","True","Vet Med (Auckl)","GI|FMT|Herein|10-year|4-kg Toy Poodle|4-year|32.8-kg|Golden Retriever|FMT","cc-by","","PMC6898721","31819862","GPE|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 2","","10.2147/VMRR.S230862","comm_use_subset"

In this review on the molecular genetics of these economically important species we give an overview about the evolutionary history, domestication and dispersal of Old World camels, whereas highlighting the need for conservation of wild two‐humped camels (Camelus ferus) as an evolutionarily unique and highly endangered species. We provide cutting‐edge information on the current molecular resources and on‐going sequencing projects. We cannot emphasise enough the importance of balancing the need for improving camel production traits with maintaining the genetic diversity in two domestic species with specific physiological adaptation to a desert environment.","6f9149e2caa1229df655448839a15cafab5a03e0","True","Anim Genet","Old World|around 3000–6000 years ago|Bactrian|Old World|Camelus|two","cc-by","","PMC6899786","31532019","ORG|DATE|NORP|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","PMC","2019 Dec 18","","10.1111/age.12858","comm_use_subset"

Therefore, we investigated the rhinovirus (RV) infection prevalence over a 2-year period, compared it with prevalence patterns of other common respiratory viruses, and explored clinical and molecular epidemiology of RV infections among 590 children hospitalized with acute respiratory infection in north-western and central parts of Croatia. For respiratory virus detection, nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal flocked swabs were taken from each patient and subsequently analyzed with multiplex RT-PCR. To determine the RV species in a subset of positive children, 5′UTR in RV-positive samples has been sequenced. Nucleotide sequences of referent RV strains were retrieved by searching the database with Basic Local Alignment Tool, and used to construct alignments and phylogenetic trees using MAFFT multiple sequence alignment tool and the maximum likelihood method, respectively. In our study population RV was the most frequently detected virus, diagnosed in 197 patients (33.4%), of which 60.4% was detected as a monoinfection. Median age of RV-infected children was 2.25 years, and more than half of children infected with RV (55.8%) presented with lower respiratory tract infections. Most RV cases were detected from September to December, and all three species co-circulated during the analyzed period (2017–2019). Sequence analysis based on 5′UTR region yielded 69 distinct strains; the most prevalent was RV-C (47.4%) followed by RV-A (44.7%) and RV-B (7.9%). Most of RV-A sequences formed a distinct phylogenetic group; only strains RI/HR409-18 (along with a reference strain MF978777) clustered with RV-C strains. Strains belonging to the group C were the most diverse (41.6% identity among strains), while group B was the most conserved (71.5% identity among strains). Despite such differences in strain groups (hitherto undescribed in Croatia), clinical presentation of infected children was rather similar. Our results are consistent with newer studies that investigated the etiology of acute respiratory infections, especially those focused on children with lower respiratory tract infections, where RVs should always be considered as potentially serious pathogens.","d10f84b9e2232aef0a3d90771b3f861208456d2d","True","Front Microbiol","RV|2-year|RV|590|Croatia|RT-PCR|RV|5′UTR|RV|RV|Basic Local Alignment Tool|MAFFT|RV|197|33.4%|60.4%|RV|2.25 years|more than half|RV|55.8%|RV|September|December|three|2017–2019|5′UTR|69|RV-C|47.4%|RV-A|44.7%|RV-B|7.9%|RV|RI/HR409-18|MF978777|RV-C|41.6%|the most conserved|71.5%|Croatia","cc-by","","PMC6901631","31849887","ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|GPE","PMC","2019 Dec 3","","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02737","comm_use_subset"

METHODS: A total of 528 patients with viral pneumonia at RuiJin hospital in Shanghai from May 2015 to May 2019 were recruited. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was used to detect respiratory viruses. Demographic information, comorbidities, routine laboratory examinations, immunological indexes, etiological detections, radiological images and treatment were collected on admission. RESULTS: 76 (14.4%) patients died within 90 days in hospital. A predictive MuLBSTA score was calculated on the basis of a multivariate logistic regression model in order to predict mortality with a weighted score that included multilobular infiltrates (OR = 5.20, 95% CI 1.41–12.52, p = 0.010; 5 points), lymphocyte ≤ 0.8(∗)10(9)/L (OR = 4.53, 95% CI 2.55–8.05, p < 0.001; 4 points), bacterial coinfection (OR = 3.71, 95% CI 2.11–6.51, p < 0.001; 4 points), acute-smoker (OR = 3.19, 95% CI 1.34–6.26, p = 0.001; 3 points), quit-smoker (OR = 2.18, 95% CI 0.99–4.82, p = 0.054; 2 points), hypertension (OR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.55–4.26, p = 0.003; 2 points) and age ≥60 years (OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.04–4.39, p = 0.038; 2 points). 12 points was used as a cut-off value for mortality risk stratification. This model showed sensitivity of 0.776, specificity of 0.778 and a better predictive ability than CURB-65 (AUROC = 0.773 vs. 0.717, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Here, we designed an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool for assessing 90-day mortality risk of viral pneumonia.

However, data about the performance of established influenza surveillance systems are limited in Africa, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). METHODS: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza sentinel surveillance system (ISSS) in DRC during 2012–2015. The performance of the system was evaluated using eight surveillance attributes: (i) data quality and completeness for key variables, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness, (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability and (viii) utility. For each attribute, specific indicators were developed and described using quantitative and qualitative methods. Scores for each indicator were as follows: < 60% weak performance; 60–79% moderate performance; ≥80% good performance. RESULTS: During 2012–2015, we enrolled and tested 4339 patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and 2869 patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) from 11 sentinel sites situated in 5 of 11 provinces. Influenza viruses were detected in 446 (10.3%) samples from patients with ILI and in 151 (5.5%) samples from patients with SARI with higher detection during December–May. Data quality and completeness was > 90% for all evaluated indicators. Other strengths of the system were timeliness, simplicity, stability and utility that scored > 70% each. Representativeness, flexibility and acceptability had moderate performance. It was reported that the ISSS contributed to: (i) a better understanding of the epidemiology, circulating patterns and proportional contribution of influenza virus among patients with ILI or SARI; (ii) acquisition of new key competences related to influenza surveillance and diagnosis; and (iii) continuous education of surveillance staff and clinicians at sentinel sites about influenza. However, due to limited resources no actions were undertaken to mitigate the impact of seasonal influenza epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: The system performed overall satisfactorily and provided reliable and timely data about influenza circulation in DRC. The simplicity of the system contributed to its stability. A better use of the available data could be made to inform and promote prevention interventions especially among the most vulnerable groups.","367aa0244a4b97d04590b92ba9dba13fccd07ce3","True","BMC Public Health","The World Health Organization|Africa|the Democratic Republic of Congo|DRC|the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|DRC|eight|60%|60–79%|≥80%|4339|ILI|2869|11|5|11|Influenza|446|10.3%|ILI|151|5.5%|December–May|90%|70%|ILI|SARI|DRC","cc-by","","PMC6902419","31823763","ORG|LOC|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|LOC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 10","","10.1186/s12889-019-8008-2","comm_use_subset"

AIM: Our objective was to evaluate the effects that statutory adjustments in the Netherlands in 2008 and raising awareness during outbreaks had on notification timeliness. METHODS: In a retrospective analyses of routine surveillance data obtained between July 2003 and November 2017, delays between disease onset and laboratory confirmation (disease identification delay), between laboratory confirmation and notification to Municipal Health Services (notification delay) and between notification and reporting to the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (reporting delay) were analysed for 28 notifiable diseases. Delays before (period 1) and after the law change (periods 2 and 3) were compared with legal timeframes. We studied the effect of outbreak awareness in 10 outbreaks and the effect of specific guidance messages on disease identification delay for two diseases. RESULTS: We included 144,066 notifications. Average notification delay decreased from 1.4 to 0.4 days across the three periods (six diseases; p < 0.05), reporting delay decreased mainly in period 2 (from 0.5 to 0.1 days, six diseases; p < 0.05). In 2016–2017, legal timeframes were met overall. Awareness resulted in decreased disease identification delay for three diseases: measles and rubella (outbreaks) and psittacosis (specific guidance messages). CONCLUSIONS: Legal adjustments decreased notification and reporting delays, increased awareness reduced identification delays. As disease identification delay dominates the notification chain, insight in patient, doctor and laboratory delay is necessary to further improve timeliness and monitor the impact of control measures during outbreaks.","d933299806fcd4e9e8a61e7760267154926c05ee","True","Euro Surveill","Netherlands|2008|between July 2003 and November 2017|Municipal Health Services|the National Institute for Public Health|28|2|3|10|two|144,066|1.4 to 0.4 days|three|six|0.05|2|0.5|0.1 days|six|0.05|2016–2017|Awareness|three","cc-by","","PMC6905299","31822327","GPE|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL","PMC","2019 Dec 5","","10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.49.1900237","comm_use_subset"

No therapeutics or vaccines are currently licensed; however, a vaccine has shown promise in clinical trials. A critical step towards development of effective therapeutics is a better understanding of factors that govern host susceptibility to this pathogen. As macrophages are an important cell population targeted during virus replication, we explore the effect of cytokine polarization on macrophage infection. METHODS/MAIN FINDINGS: We utilized a BSL2 EBOV model virus, infectious, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding EBOV glycoprotein (GP) (rVSV/EBOV GP) in place of its native glycoprotein. Macrophages polarized towards a M2-like anti-inflammatory state by combined IL-4 and IL-13 treatment were more susceptible to rVSV/EBOV GP, but not to wild-type VSV (rVSV/G), suggesting that EBOV GP-dependent entry events were enhanced by these cytokines. Examination of RNA expression of known surface receptors that bind and internalize filoviruses demonstrated that IL-4/IL-13 stimulated expression of the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN in human macrophages and addition of the competitive inhibitor mannan abrogated IL-4/IL-13 enhanced infection. Two murine DC-SIGN-like family members, SIGNR3 and SIGNR5, were upregulated by IL-4/IL-13 in murine macrophages, but only SIGNR3 enhanced virus infection in a mannan-inhibited manner, suggesting that murine SIGNR3 plays a similar role to human DC-SIGN. In vivo IL-4/IL-13 administration significantly increased virus-mediated mortality in a mouse model and transfer of ex vivo IL-4/IL-13-treated murine peritoneal macrophages into the peritoneal cavity of mice enhanced pathogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: These studies highlight the ability of macrophage polarization to influence EBOV GP-dependent virus replication in vivo and ex vivo, with M2a polarization upregulating cell surface receptor expression and thereby enhancing virus replication. Our findings provide an increased understanding of the host factors in macrophages governing susceptibility to filoviruses and identify novel murine receptors mediating EBOV entry.","29e94dee0df31f591c6f09c590e4c3523a14e647","True","PLoS Negl Trop Dis","METHODS|BSL2 EBOV|M2-like|EBOV|RNA|IL-4/IL-13|DC-SIGN|IL-4/IL-13|Two|DC-SIGN|SIGNR3|IL-4/IL-13|DC-SIGN|SIGNIFICANCE|EBOV","cc-by","","PMC6905523","31825972","ORG|WORK_OF_ART|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|GPE|CARDINAL|LOC|PERSON|ORG|FAC|GPE|PERSON","PMC","2019 Dec 11","","10.1371/journal.pntd.0007819","comm_use_subset"
"Zhou, Danju; Pender, Michelle; Jiang, Weixi; Mao, Wenhui; Tang, Shenglan","Under-reporting of TB cases and associated factors: a case study in China","BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is a leading cause of death worldwide and has become a high global health priority. Accurate country level surveillance is critical to ending the pandemic. Effective routine reporting systems which track the course of the epidemic are vital in addressing TB. China, which has the third largest TB epidemic in the world and has developed a reporting system to help with the control and prevention of TB, this study examined its effectiveness in Eastern China. METHODS: The number of TB cases reported internally in two hospitals in Eastern China were compared to the number TB cases reported by these same hospitals in the national reporting systems in order to assess the accuracy of reporting. Qualitative data from interviews with key health officials and researcher experience using the TB reporting systems were used to identify factors affecting the accuracy of TB cases being reported in the national systems. RESULTS: This study found that over a quarter of TB cases recorded in the internal hospital records were not entered into the national TB reporting systems, leading to an under representation of national TB cases. Factors associated with underreporting included unqualified and overworked health personnel, poor supervision and accountability at local and national levels, and a complicated incohesive health information management system. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that TB in Eastern China is being underreported. Given that Eastern China is a developed province, one could assume similar problems may be found in other parts of China with fewer resources as well as many low- and middle-income countries. Having an accurate account of the number of national TB cases is essential to understanding the national and global burden of the disease and in managing TB prevention and control efforts. As such, factors associated with underreporting need to be addressed in order to reduce underreporting.","2cd9b37d110968368ce6f837e002788ac6158af8","True","BMC Public Health","China|third|TB|TB|Eastern China|two|Eastern China|TB in Eastern China|Eastern China|China|TB","cc-by","","PMC6907198","31829147","GPE|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|LOC|CARDINAL|LOC|ORG|LOC|GPE|NORP","PMC","2019 Dec 11","","10.1186/s12889-019-8009-1","comm_use_subset"

The use of the mask without MF increased the End-Tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)) and Fractional concentration of Inspired CO(2) (FICO(2)) at rest and on mild exertion, as expected. The use of the mask with MF brought FICO(2) levels comparably closer to baseline levels without the mask for both activities. The mask, with or without the MF, was found to be well fitting, comfortable and safe for use in children at rest and on mild exertion. The N95 mask tested offers a promising start for more studies in the paediatric population.","ab3c4f88e655875b72719f078f4e1e4fd4459445","True","Sci Rep","today|N95|MF|7–14 years|two|subjects’|MF|106|between July-August 2016|MF|the End-Tidal CO(2|Fractional|Inspired CO(2|MF|MF|N95","cc-by","","PMC6908682","31831801","DATE|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|PRODUCT|NORP|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 12","","10.1038/s41598-019-55451-w","comm_use_subset"

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)-coupled C-type lectins (CLECs) CLEC2 and CLEC5A are highly expressed on platelets and myeloid cells, respectively. CLEC2 has been shown to recognize snake venom aggretin and the endogenous ligand podoplanin and acts as a critical regulator in the development and immunothrombosis. Although CLEC2 has been reported to interact with type I immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), its role in viral infections is still unclear. CLEC5A binds to fucose and mannose moieties of dengue virus membrane glycans, as well as to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)/N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) disaccharides that form the backbone of L. monocytogenes peptidoglycans. Recently, we demonstrated that both CLEC2 and CLEC5A are critical in microbe-induced “neutrophil extracellular trap” (NET) formation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, activation of CLEC2 by dengue virus (DV) and H5N1 influenza virus (IAV) induces the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which further enhance NETosis and proinflammatory cytokine production via CLEC5A and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). These findings not only illustrate the immunomodulatory effects of EVs during platelet-leukocyte interactions, but also demonstrate the critical roles of CLEC2 and CLEC5A in acute viral infections.","9e953d462385492fa9cc2ada05c1fd357de8afed","True","Front Immunol","CLECs|HIV-1|N-acetylglucosamine|GlcNAc)/N|L.|NET|H5N1|NETosis|Toll|2","cc-by","","PMC6909378","31867016","ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","PMC","2019 Dec 6","","10.3389/fimmu.2019.02867","comm_use_subset"

"Papa, Guido; Venditti, Luca; Arnoldi, Francesca; Schraner, Elisabeth M.; Potgieter, Christiaan; Borodavka, Alexander; Eichwald, Catherine; Burrone, Oscar R.","Recombinant Rotaviruses Rescued by Reverse Genetics Reveal the Role of NSP5 Hyperphosphorylation in the Assembly of Viral Factories","Rotavirus (RV) replicates in round-shaped cytoplasmic viral factories, although how they assemble remains unknown. During RV infection, NSP5 undergoes hyperphosphorylation, which is primed by the phosphorylation of a single serine residue. The role of this posttranslational modification in the formation of viroplasms and its impact on virus replication remain obscure. Here, we investigated the role of NSP5 during RV infection by taking advantage of a modified fully tractable reverse-genetics system. A trans-complementing cell line stably producing NSP5 was used to generate and characterize several recombinant rotaviruses (rRVs) with mutations in NSP5. We demonstrate that an rRV lacking NSP5 was completely unable to assemble viroplasms and to replicate, confirming its pivotal role in rotavirus replication. A number of mutants with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation were generated to further interrogate the function of this posttranslational modification in the assembly of replication-competent viroplasms. We showed that the rRV mutant strains exhibited impaired viral replication and the ability to assemble round-shaped viroplasms in MA104 cells. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during RV infection using NSP5 phosphorylation-negative rRV strains, as well as MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines expressing either wild-type NSP5 or selected NSP5 deletion mutants. Our results indicate that NSP5 hyperphosphorylation is a crucial step for the assembly of round-shaped viroplasms, highlighting the key role of the C-terminal tail of NSP5 in the formation of replication-competent viral factories. Such a complex NSP5 phosphorylation cascade may serve as a paradigm for the assembly of functional viral factories in other RNA viruses. IMPORTANCE The rotavirus (RV) double-stranded RNA genome is replicated and packaged into virus progeny in cytoplasmic structures termed viroplasms. The nonstructural protein NSP5, which undergoes a complex hyperphosphorylation process during RV infection, is required for the formation of these virus-induced organelles. However, its roles in viroplasm formation and RV replication have never been directly assessed due to the lack of a fully tractable reverse-genetics (RG) system for rotaviruses. Here, we show a novel application of a recently developed RG system by establishing a stable trans-complementing NSP5-producing cell line required to rescue rotaviruses with mutations in NSP5. This approach allowed us to provide the first direct evidence of the pivotal role of this protein during RV replication. Furthermore, using recombinant RV mutants, we shed light on the molecular mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during infection and its involvement in the assembly and maturation of replication-competent viroplasms.","6a6032614741732c373d0a939ce85785519c3fa6","True","J Virol","Rotavirus|RV|RV|RV|NSP5|rRVs|NSP5|rRV|NSP5|rRV|MA104|RV|NSP5|rRV|NSP5|RNA|IMPORTANCE The|RV|RNA|NSP5|RV|RV|RG|RG|NSP5|first|RV|RV|NSP5","cc-by","","PMC6912106","31619556","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|PERSON|NORP|GPE|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 12","","10.1128/JVI.01110-19","comm_use_subset"
"Ng, Ta-Chou; Wen, Tzai-Hung","Spatially Adjusted Time-varying Reproductive Numbers: Understanding the Geographical Expansion of Urban Dengue Outbreaks","The basic reproductive number (R(0)) is a fundamental measure used to quantify the transmission potential of an epidemic in public health practice. However, R(0) cannot reflect the time-varying nature of an epidemic. A time-varying effective reproductive number R(t) can provide more information because it tracks the subsequent evolution of transmission. However, since it neglects individual-level geographical variations in exposure risk, R(t) may smooth out interpersonal heterogeneous transmission potential, obscure high-risk spreaders, and hence hamper the effectiveness of control measures in spatial dimension. Therefore, this study proposes a new method for quantifying spatially adjusted (time-varying) reproductive numbers that reflects spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals. This new method estimates individual-level effective reproductive numbers (R(j)) and a summarized indicator for population-level time-varying reproductive number (R(t)). Data from the five most severe dengue outbreaks in southern Taiwan from 1998–2015 were used to demonstrate the ability of the method to highlight early spreaders contributing to the geographic expansion of dengue transmission. Our results show spatial heterogeneity in the transmission potential of dengue among individuals and identify the spreaders with the highest R(j) during the epidemic period. The results also reveal that super-spreaders are usually early spreaders that locate at the edges of the epidemic foci, which means that these cases could be the drivers of the expansion of the outbreak. Therefore, our proposed method depicts a more detailed spatial-temporal dengue transmission process and identifies the significant role of the edges of the epidemic foci, which could be weak spots in disease control and prevention.","98f9843f4b024272b6514db6e53546839101a839","True","Sci Rep","R(0|five|Taiwan|1998–2015","cc-by","","PMC6914775","31844099","PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL","PMC","2019 Dec 16","","10.1038/s41598-019-55574-0","comm_use_subset"

METHOD: Gastrointestinal endoscopes after reprocessing were selected randomly at the gastrointestinal endoscopy center of a tertiary hospital in Shanghai from October 2018 to February 2019. The endoscopes selected were all sampled in three different methods under continuous sampling and intermittent sampling respectively. Methods used includes, the biopsy channel group (Group A), the entire channel group (Group B), and the disc brush group (Group C). Then the colony forming units (CFU/piece) were counted in the laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 12 endoscopes were sampled by using continuous sampling approach, in which the detection rate of bacteria in disc brush group (33.3%) and entire channel group (33.3%) was higher than biopsy channel group (8.3%). Among the 12 endoscopes sampled with intermittent approach, the detection rate of bacteria from high to low was the disc brush group (50%), the entire channel group (41.7%), and the biopsy channel group (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Different sampling methods will lead to the difference of microbiological culture results after reprocessing of gastrointestinal endoscope, indicating that the improved sampling method is beneficial to objectively reflect the endoscope cleaning and disinfection effect, and improve the monitoring quality of endoscope disinfection.","0ca5279816f66f7fd8c0bdb09d15f5953e019b68","True","Biomed Res Int","three|tertiary|Shanghai|October 2018 to February 2019|three|Group A|Group B|Group C|CFU/|12|33.3%|33.3%|8.3%|12|50%|41.7%|8.3%","cc-by","","PMC6914964","31886251","CARDINAL|ORDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|QUANTITY|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT","PMC","2019 Dec 3","","10.1155/2019/7940468","comm_use_subset"

Since the first confirmed ASF outbreak in China on 3 August 2018, 156 ASF outbreaks were detected in 32 provinces. About 1,170,000 pigs were culled in order to halt further spread. There is no effective treatment or vaccine for it and the present molecular diagnosis technologies have trade-offs in sensitivity, specificity, cost and speed, and none of them cater perfectly to ASF control. Thus, a technology that overcomes the need for laboratory facilities, is relatively low cost, and rapidly and sensitively detects ASFV would be highly valuable. Here, we describe an RAA-Cas12a-based system that combines recombinase aided amplification (RAA) and CRISPR/Cas12a for ASFV detection. The fluorescence intensity readout of this system detected ASFV p72 gene levels as low as 10 aM. For on-site ASFV detection, lateral-flow strip readout was introduced for the first time in the RAA-Cas12a based system (named CORDS, Cas12a-based On-site and Rapid Detection System). We used CORDS to detect target DNA highly specifically using the lateral-flow strip readout and the assay displayed no cross-reactivity to other 13 swine viruses including classical swine fever (CSF). CORDS could identify the ASFV DNA target at femtomolar sensitivity in an hour at 37°C, and only requires an incubator. For ease of use, the reagents of CORDS were lyophilized to three tubes and remained the same sensitivity when stored at 4°C for at least 7 days. Thus, CORDS provide a rapid, sensitive and easily operable method for ASFV on-site detection. Lyophilized CORDS can withstand long-term transportation and storage, and is ready for field-based applications.","0c1318a0ed68a50f13ef04c2cd0741d2e7016104","True","Front Microbiol","African|ASF|African|ASFV|100%|first|ASF|China|3 August 2018|156|ASF|32|About 1,170,000|ASF|ASFV|CRISPR/Cas12a|ASFV|ASFV|as low as|ASFV|first|CORDS|Cas12a|Rapid Detection System|CORDS|13|CSF|CORDS|ASFV|an hour|CORDS|three|4|at least 7 days|CORDS|ASFV|CORDS","cc-by","","PMC6916198","31921018","NORP|ORG|NORP|ORG|PERCENT|ORDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|TIME|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 10","","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02830","comm_use_subset"

Lessons from the case of a Zika virus human challenge trial","Human challenge trials (HCTs) deliberately infect participants in order to test vaccines and treatments in a controlled setting, rather than enrolling individuals with natural exposure to a disease. HCTs are therefore potentially powerful tools to prepare for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. Yet when an infectious disease is emerging, there is often substantial risk and uncertainty about its complications, and few available interventions, making an HCT ethically complex. In light of the need to consider ethical issues proactively as a part of epidemic preparedness, we use the case of a Zika virus HCT to explore whether and when HCTs might be ethically justified to combat emerging infectious diseases. We conclude that emerging infectious diseases could be appropriate candidates for HCTs and we identify relevant considerations and provide a case example to illustrate when they might be ethically acceptable.","8eb3bdc336b90a70201e28477934062f67afcbcf","True","Trials","HCT|Zika|HCT","cc-by","","PMC6921433","31852506","ORG|PRODUCT|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 19","","10.1186/s13063-019-3843-0","comm_use_subset"

Although the rate of macrolide-refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) has increased, systemic glucocorticoids as a treatment option has not been validated yet. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of glucocorticoids add-on in the treatment of MRMP in children through systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Data sources A systematic literature search was conducted using ten electronic bibliographic databases including English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese languages, up to March 8, 2018. Study selection The study was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist and selected randomized control trials which compared the efficacy of glucocorticoids add-on to macrolide in the treatment of MRMP in children. Data extraction Two independent reviewers extracted: primary outcomes as hospital days, fever duration, and change in C-reactive protein (CRP) and main analysis was performed through meta-analysis with random effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-four unique randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. The mean length of hospital stay in glucocorticoids treatment group was significantly shorter than that in conventional macrolide-treatment group (Weighted mean difference (WMD) = − 4.03 days). The mean length of fever duration was significantly shorter in the glucocorticoid treatment group in comparison with the conventional treatment group (WMD = -3.32 days). Level of CRP after treatment was significantly lower in the glucocorticoid treatment group than that in the conventional treatment group (WMD = -16.03). Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis showed no significant improvement in heterogeneity. As limitations of the study, most of the studies included were from a single country and we were unable to control for heterogeneity across interventions, lack of standardized measures, and different time points of assessments across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Glucocorticoid add-on treatment for MRMP can significantly shorten the duration of fever and hospital stay and decrease the level of CRP. These results should be confirmed by adequately powered studies in the future.","9a8ffdaee3a800f0e6867b63ffd109e9c30621b8","True","BMC Pulm Med","one|Mycoplasma|MRMP|MRMP|METHODS|ten|English|Korean|Chinese|Japanese|up to March 8, 2018|Systematic Reviews|Meta-Analyses|MRMP|Two|Twenty-four|Weighted|WMD|4.03 days|MRMP","cc-by","","PMC6921474","31852460","CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|LANGUAGE|NORP|NORP|NORP|DATE|NORP|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|DATE|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 18","","10.1186/s12890-019-0990-8","comm_use_subset"

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role within the innate immune system and TLR7 agonists have previously been shown to up-regulate Th1 responses and down-regulate Th2 responses to allergens in murine models of allergic or chronic asthma. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of the novel TRL7 agonist AZD8848, which has been developed as an antedrug. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, AZD8848 60 μg or placebo was administered intranasally once-weekly for 8 weeks in patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma (NCT00999466). Efficacy assessments were performed at 1 and 4 weeks after the last dose. The primary outcome was the late asthmatic response (LAR) fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) after allergen challenge at 1-week post-treatment. RESULTS: AZD8848 significantly reduced average LAR fall in FEV(1) by 27% vs. placebo at 1 week after treatment (p = 0.035). This effect was sustained at 4 weeks post-treatment; however, it did not reach clinical significance. AZD8848 reduced post-allergen challenge methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) vs. placebo at 1 week post-dosing (treatment ratio: 2.20, p = 0.024), with no effect at 4 weeks. There was no significant difference between the two groups in plasma cytokine, sputum Th2 cytokine or eosinophil responses post-allergen challenge at 1 week after treatment. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. AZD8848 was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In patients with allergic asthma, TLR7 agonists could potentially reduce allergen responsiveness by stimulating Type 1 interferon responses to down-regulate the dominant Th2 responses.

However, little is known of the role of IL-11 during viral infections. In this study, IL-11 expression at mRNA and protein levels were found to be high in Vero cells and the jejunum of piglets during porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, while IL-11 expression was found to be positively correlated with the level of viral infection. Pretreatment with recombinant porcine IL-11 (pIL-11) was found to suppress PEDV replication in Vero E6 cells, while IL-11 knockdown promoted viral infection. Furthermore, pIL-11 was found to inhibit viral infection by preventing PEDV-mediated apoptosis of cells by activating the IL-11/STAT3 signaling pathway. Conversely, application of a STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor significantly antagonized the anti-apoptosis function of pIL-11 and counteracted its inhibition of PEDV. Our data suggest that IL-11 is a newfound PEDV-inducible cytokine, and its production enhances the anti-apoptosis ability of epithelial cells against PEDV infection. The potential of IL-11 to be used as a novel therapeutic against devastating viral diarrhea in piglets deserves more attention and study.","8d3f0c18b7b274179244f57cd8f66e185a009dd5","True","Vet Res","IL-11|IL-11|IL-11|Vero|IL-11|IL-11|Vero E6|IL-11|STAT3|PEDV|IL-11|IL-11","cc-by","","PMC6925494","31864417","ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|NORP|GPE|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 21","","10.1186/s13567-019-0729-9","comm_use_subset"

Little evidence is available about entry and exit screening measure implementation and effectiveness at ports and ground crossings. Exit screening was part of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) temporary recommendations for implementation in certain points of entry, for specific time periods.

In this paper, a controlled differential equation and an objective function of infectious diseases were established by mathematical modeling. Based on cellular automata theory and a compartmental model, the SLIRDS (Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Susceptible) model was constructed, a model which can better reflect the actual infectious process of infectious diseases. Considering the spread of disease in different populations, the model combines population density, sex ratio, and age structure to set the evolution rules of the model. Finally, on the basis of the SLIRDS model, the complex spread process of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was simulated. The simulation results are similar to the macroscopic characteristics of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in real life, thus the accuracy and rationality of the SLIRDS model are confirmed.","a780aef42860533f02e613494ddb8283b9fbe83d","True","Int J Environ Res Public Health","SLIRDS|H1N1|H1N1|SLIRDS","cc-by","","PMC6926909","31775236","ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 25","","10.3390/ijerph16234683","comm_use_subset"

While risks vary for different communities, disaster and emergency preparedness is recognized as essential for all nation-states. Evidence to inform measurement of preparedness is lacking. The objective of this study was to identify and define a set of public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) indicators to advance performance measurement for local/regional public health agencies. METHODS: A three-round modified Delphi technique was employed to develop indicators for PHEP. The study was conducted in Canada with a national panel of 33 experts and completed in 2018. A list of indicators was derived from the literature. Indicators were rated by importance and actionability until achieving consensus. RESULTS: The scoping review resulted in 62 indicators being included for rating by the panel. Panel feedback provided refinements to indicators and suggestions for new indicators. In total, 76 indicators were proposed for rating across all three rounds; of these, 67 were considered to be important and actionable PHEP indicators. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed an indicator set of 67 PHEP indicators, aligned with a PHEP framework for resilience. The 67 indicators represent important and actionable dimensions of PHEP practice in Canada that can be used by local/regional public health agencies and validated in other jurisdictions to assess readiness and measure improvement in their critical role of protecting community health.","ed92789659fddd64f955bda40d980398b681bb6b","True","PLoS One","three|Delphi|PHEP|Canada|33|2018|62|76|three|67|67|PHEP|67|Canada","cc-by","","PMC6927653","31869359","CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE","PMC","2019 Dec 23","","10.1371/journal.pone.0226489","comm_use_subset"

Patients with other complications were older, male, and had the highest influenza B rates and the longest length of stay. Influenza A comprised 76.9% of cases and had higher complication rates especially neurologic, compared to influenza B. Influenza B patients were older and were more likely to develop other complications. The 6‐month to <5‐year‐age‐group had the highest complication rate (30.6%), especially neurologic. However, ≥10 years old had the highest other complications, ICU/ high‐dependency admissions and influenza B Victoria rates. CONCLUSIONS: Infants <6 months had the highest hospitalization rates for influenza. The 6‐month to <5‐year‐age‐group had the highest complication rate especially neurologic. Influenza A patients were younger, had higher seizure rates and complications compared to influenza B.","5e3580584a2340a7db087f4115d14f6782e22a36","True","Influenza Other Respir Viruses","Singapore|B.

"Yu, Yunjia; Zhang, Yang; Wang, Shuyao; Liu, Wei; Hao, Cui; Wang, Wei","Inhibition effects of patchouli alcohol against influenza a virus through targeting cellular PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways","BACKGROUND: Patchouli alcohol (PA) is a tricyclic sesquiterpene extracted from Pogostemonis Herba, which is a traditional Chinese medicine used for therapy of inflammatory diseases. Recent studies have shown that PA has various pharmacological activities, including anti-bacterial and anti-viral effects. METHODS: In this study, the anti-influenza virus (IAV) activities and mechanisms were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The inhibitory effects of PA against IAV in vitro were evaluated by plaque assay and immunofluorescence assay. The neuraminidase inhibition assay, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and western blot assay were used to explore the anti-viral mechanisms. The anti-IAV activities in vivo were determined by mice pneumonia model and HE staining. RESULTS: The results showed that PA significantly inhibited different IAV strains multiplication in vitro, and may block IAV infection through inactivating virus particles directly and interfering with some early stages after virus adsorption. Cellular PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways may be involved in the anti-IAV actions of PA. Intranasal administration of PA markedly improved mice survival and attenuated pneumonia symptoms in IAV infected mice, comparable to the effects of Oseltamivir. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, Patchouli alcohol has the potential to be developed into a novel anti-IAV agent in the future.","4dd9d9ada59d79f3212e4451dd620f25cc84d86d","True","Virol J","PA|Pogostemonis|Herba|Chinese|PA|PA|anti|PA|Akt|ERK|MAPK|PA|PA|Oseltamivir","cc-by","","PMC6929483","31870450","ORG|NORP|GPE|NORP|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT","PMC","2019 Dec 23","","10.1186/s12985-019-1266-x","comm_use_subset"

However, available data on the immune pathogenesis in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients affected by dengue is insufficient. We performed an in vitro study to evaluate the sequential immunological reactions and viral load in dengue virus type 2-infected mononuclear cells of patients with ESRD (n = 34) and in healthy controls (n = 30). The concentrations of interleukins (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (Ra), IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1b (MIP-1b), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and viral load cycle threshold (Ct) were measured in the dengue virus type 2-infected mononuclear cells at 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection. We found in the ESRD group significantly higher GM-CSF and IL-2 levels at 6 h post-infection. However, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1b levels were found significantly lower than in the control group. At 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection, significantly lower levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1b were detected in ESRD group. Concentration of VEGF at 24 h and 48 h, and of GM-CSF at 48 h and 72 h were also found to be lower in ESRD group than in control group. Compared with controls, the viral load Ct values were significantly lower in ESRD group at 6 h and 24 h post-infection No significant difference in viral load Ct values between two groups was found at 48 h and 72 h post-infection.

"Yan, Cheng; Duan, Guihua; Wu, Fang-Xiang; Wang, Jianxin","IILLS: predicting virus-receptor interactions based on similarity and semi-supervised learning","BACKGROUND: Viral infectious diseases are the serious threat for human health. The receptor-binding is the first step for the viral infection of hosts. To more effectively treat human viral infectious diseases, the hidden virus-receptor interactions must be discovered. However, current computational methods for predicting virus-receptor interactions are limited. RESULT: In this study, we propose a new computational method (IILLS) to predict virus-receptor interactions based on Initial Interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square algorithm. IILLS integrates the known virus-receptor interactions and amino acid sequences of receptors. The similarity of viruses is calculated by the Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel. On the other hand, we also compute the receptor GIP similarity and the receptor sequence similarity. Then the sequence similarity is used as the final similarity of receptors according to the prediction results. The 10-fold cross validation (10CV) and leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) are used to assess the prediction performance of our method. We also compare our method with other three competing methods (BRWH, LapRLS, CMF). CONLUSION: The experiment results show that IILLS achieves the AUC values of 0.8675 and 0.9061 with the 10-fold cross validation and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), respectively, which illustrates that IILLS is superior to the competing methods. In addition, the case studies also further indicate that the IILLS method is effective for the virus-receptor interaction prediction.","67d23e2a0388959fbee3dfa60b7097acaebfe4dc","True","BMC Bioinformatics","first|Initial Interaction|Laplacian|Least Square|the Gaussian Interaction Profile (|GIP|GIP|10-fold|one|LOOCV|three|CMF|AUC|0.8675|0.9061|10-fold|one|LOOCV","cc-by","","PMC6933616","31881820","ORDINAL|ORG|NORP|FAC|FAC|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE","PMC","2019 Dec 27","","10.1186/s12859-019-3278-3","comm_use_subset"

However, existing RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms cannot predict the pseudoknot structure efficiently. Although random matching can improve the number of base pairs, these non-consecutive base pairs cannot make contributions to reduce the free energy. RESULT: In order to improve the efficiency of searching procedure, our algorithm take consecutive base pairs as the basic components. Firstly, our algorithm calculates and archive all the consecutive base pairs in triplet data structure, if the number of consecutive base pairs is greater than given minimum stem length. Secondly, the annealing schedule is adapted to select the optimal solution that has minimum free energy. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated with the real instances in PseudoBase.

"Dudas, Gytis; Bedford, Trevor","The ability of single genes vs full genomes to resolve time and space in outbreak analysis","BACKGROUND: Inexpensive pathogen genome sequencing has had a transformative effect on the field of phylodynamics, where ever increasing volumes of data have promised real-time insight into outbreaks of infectious disease. As well as the sheer volume of pathogen isolates being sequenced, the sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, rather than select loci, has allowed phylogenetic analyses to be carried out at finer time scales, often approaching serial intervals for infections caused by rapidly evolving RNA viruses. Despite its utility, whole genome sequencing of pathogens has not been adopted universally and targeted sequencing of loci is common in some pathogen-specific fields. RESULTS: In this study we highlighted the utility of sequencing whole genomes of pathogens by re-analysing a well-characterised collection of Ebola virus sequences in the form of complete viral genomes (≈19 kb long) or the rapidly evolving glycoprotein (GP, ≈2 kb long) gene. We have quantified changes in phylogenetic, temporal, and spatial inference resolution as a result of this reduction in data and compared these to theoretical expectations. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a simple intuitive metric for quantifying temporal resolution, i.e. the time scale over which sequence data might be informative of various processes as a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation of statistical power available to molecular clock analyses.","479ade65b7f5219559c4d8cc48c1c2f90bda977f","True","BMC Evol Biol","RNA|GP","cc-by","","PMC6933756","31878875","ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 26","","10.1186/s12862-019-1567-0","comm_use_subset"
"Folgueira, Lola; Moral, Noelia; Pascual, Consuelo; Delgado, Rafael","Comparison of the Panther Fusion and Allplex assays for the detection of respiratory viruses in clinical samples","Respiratory viral infections are the most frequent clinical syndrome affecting both children and adults, and early detection is fundamental to avoid infection-related risks and reduce the healthcare costs incurred by unnecessary antibiotic treatments. In this study, performance characteristics of two commercial methods, the Panther Fusion® assay (Hologic Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were compared to Allplex(™) respiratory panels (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) for the detection of influenza A (Flu A), influenza B (Flu B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinovirus (RV) and adenovirus (AdV) targets. A total of 865 specimens collected prospectively and retrospectively were included, and discordant results were further examined using another commercial product, R-GENE(™) respiratory kits (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). There was high agreement between both methods, with 98.6% concordance and a kappa (k) value of 0.9 (95% CI: 0.89–0.92). A specific analysis of both methods for each viral agent demonstrated comparable sensitivity and specificity, both ranging from 0.83 to 1 with good predictive values for the prospective part of the study. Good agreement between both methods was also found for the κ values obtained (ranging from 97.55% to 98.9%), with the lowest for hMPV (k = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75–0.91) and RV (k = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.65–0.81). Amplification efficiency, measured according to the value of the cycle threshold (C(t)) obtained in each of the amplifications in both tests, was significantly better with Panther Fusion for Flu A, Flu B, hMPV and RV. Regarding discordant results, R-GENE showed higher agreement with Panther Fusion-positive specimens (negative for Allplex; n = 28/71, 34.9%) than with Allplex-positive samples (negative for Panther Fusion; n = 7/49, 14.3%). In summary, Panther Fusion proved to be a more efficient fully-automated methodology, requiring shorter hands-on and turnaround times than Allplex.","baae1b488b6763192f01d394138315d92f75c426","True","PLoS One","two|the Panther Fusion|Hologic Inc.|San Diego|CA, USA|Allplex(™|Seegene|Seoul|South Korea|A (Flu A|RSV|PIV|RV|865|™|bioMérieux|Marcy|l’Etoile|France|98.6%|0.9|95%|CI|0.83|1|97.55%|0.83|95%|CI|0.75–0.91|RV|0.73|95%|CI|Panther Fusion for Flu A|Flu B|RV|Panther Fusion-|Allplex|28/71|34.9%|Allplex|Panther Fusion|7/49|14.3%|Panther Fusion|Allplex","cc-by","","PMC6934309","31881030","CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|WORK_OF_ART|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 27","","10.1371/journal.pone.0226403","comm_use_subset"

To date, few studies have investigated [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 metabolism in vivo in rats with no studies examining its stability in humans. We therefore aimed to develop an LC-MS/MS method for detection and quantification of intact [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 and have used this method to identify the metabolites generated in vivo in humans. [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 (135 nmol/min) was infused into six healthy human volunteers for 120 minutes and blood collected at time 0 and 120 minutes after infusion. Plasma was extracted in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride and analysed by LC-MS/MS. Here we report a highly sensitive, robust and reproducible method for quantification of intact [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 and its metabolites in human plasma. Using this method, we showed that the circulating concentration of intact peptide was 58.3 ± 10.5 ng/ml after 120 minutes infusion. We demonstrated for the first time that in humans, [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 was cleaved from both termini but the C-terminal was more susceptible to cleavage. Consequently, of the metabolites identified, [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–12)), [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–10)) and [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–6)) were the most abundant.

To investigate the prevalence and genetic evolution of diarrhea-associated viruses responsible for the outbreaks, a total of 2987 field diarrheal samples collected from 168 pig farms in five provinces in Southern China during 2012–2018 were tested. RESULTS: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was most frequently detected virus with prevalence rates between 50.21 and 62.10% in samples, and 96.43% (162/168) in premises, respectively. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was the second prevalent virus with prevalence rates ranging from 19.62 to 29.19% in samples, and 70.24% (118/168) in premises, respectively. Both transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) were detected at low prevalence rates of < 3% in samples and 10.12% in premises. In this study, we identified a newly emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) in diarrheal samples of piglets from Fujian province in Southern China, and the prevalence rate of SADS-CoV was 10.29% (7/68). Co-infections of these diarrhea-associated viruses were common. The most frequent co-infection was PEDV with PDCoV, with an average detection rate of 12.72% (380/2987, ranging from 8.26–17.33%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PEDVs circulating in Southern China during the last 7 years were clustered with the variant strains of PEDV in genotype IIa. The most frequent mutations were present in the collagenase equivalent (COE) and epitope regions of the spike gene of the PEDVs currently circulating in the field. Genetic relationships of PDCoVs were closely related with Chinese strains, other than those present in the USA, South Korea, Thailand and Lao’s public. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicated that variant PEDV, PDCoV, and SADS-CoV were leading etiologic agents of porcine diarrhea, and either mono-infections or co-infections of pathogenic enteric CoVs were common in pigs in Southern China during 2012–2018.

"Nirala, Narsingh R.; Harel, Yifat; Lellouche, Jean-Paul; Shtenberg, Giorgi","Ultrasensitive haptoglobin biomarker detection based on amplified chemiluminescence of magnetite nanoparticles","BACKGROUND: Haptoglobin is an acute-phase protein used as predicting diagnostic biomarker both in humans (i.e., diabetes, ovarian cancer, some neurological and cardiovascular disorders) and in animals (e.g., bovine mastitis). The latter is a frequent disease of dairy industry with staggering economical losses upon decreased milk production and increased health care costs. Early stage diagnosis of the associated diseases or inflammation onset is almost impossible by conventional analytical manners. RESULTS: The present study demonstrates a simple, rapid, and cost-effective label-free chemiluminescence bioassay based on magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) for sensitive detection of haptoglobin by employing the specific interaction of hemoglobin-modified MNPs. The resulting haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex inhibits the peroxidase-like activity of luminol/H(2)O(2)-hemoglobin-MNPs sensing scheme and reduces the chemiluminescence intensities correspondingly to the innate haptoglobin concentrations. Quantitative detection of bovine haptoglobin was obtained within the range of 1 pg mL(−1) to 1 µg mL(−1), while presenting 0.89 pg mL(−1) limit of detection. Moreover, the influence of causative pathogenic bacteria (i.e., Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Escherichia coli) and somatic cell counts (depicting healthy, sub-clinical and clinical mastitis) on the emitted chemiluminescence radiation were established. The presented bioassay quantitative performances correspond with a standardized assay kit in differentiating dissimilar milk qualities. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the main advantage of the presented sensing concept is the ability to detect haptoglobin, at clinically relevant concentrations within real milk samples for early bio-diagnostic detection of mastitis and hence adjusting the precise treatment, potentially initiating a positive influence on animals’ individual health and hence on dairy farms economy.","0391c13dbb9949494913c209424ed61d3a652753","True","J Nanobiotechnology","Haptoglobin|H(2)O(2)-hemoglobin|1|1|0.89|Streptococcus|Escherichia|animals’","cc-by","","PMC6945394","31910856","GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|PERSON|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 7","","10.1186/s12951-019-0569-9","comm_use_subset"

In order to understand their transmission dynamics, it is crucial, even from a human health perspective, to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence. Bats are important reservoirs for adenoviruses, and here we use the results of recent screenings in Western Europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their probability of hosting adenoviruses, taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. Across species, we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of adenoviruses and mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of adenoviruses across bat species. Contrary to other more stable mating strategies (e.g. harems), swarming could hinder transmission of adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals are too short. Alternatively, bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger immune system. Outstandingly high prevalence of adenoviruses was reported for the Iberian species Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. kuhlii and Nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter, males were more likely to be infected by adenoviruses than females, due to the immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season. As a general trend across species, we found that the number of adenoviruses positive individuals was different across localities and that the difference in prevalence between populations was correlated with their geographic distances for two of the three studied bat species (P. pygmaeus and P.kuhlii). These results increase our knowledge about the transmission mechanisms of adenoviruses.","879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342","True","PLoS One","Western Europe|Iberian|Nyctalus|two|three|P.kuhlii","cc-by","","PMC6946596","31910439","LOC|NORP|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 7","","10.1371/journal.pone.0226203","comm_use_subset"
"Good, Steven S.; Moussa, Adel; Zhou, Xiao-Jian; Pietropaolo, Keith; Sommadossi, Jean-Pierre","Preclinical evaluation of AT-527, a novel guanosine nucleotide prodrug with potent, pan-genotypic activity against hepatitis C virus","Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal for difficult-to-treat patient populations such as those with HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience, warranting development of more potent HCV replication antivirals. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a novel phosphoramidate prodrug of 2’-fluoro-2’-C-methylguanosine-5'-monophosphate that has potent in vitro activity against HCV. The EC(50) of AT-511, determined using HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates with genotypes 1–5, ranged from 5–28 nM. The active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, specifically inhibited the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AT-511 did not inhibit the replication of other selected RNA or DNA viruses in vitro. AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1–5 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 μM. Unlike the other potent guanosine analogs PSI-938 and PSI-661, no mutagenic O(6)-alkylguanine bases were formed when incubated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and AT-511 had IC(50) values ≥25 μM against a panel of CYP enzymes. In hepatocytes from multiple species, the active triphosphate was the predominant metabolite produced from the prodrug, with a half-life of 10 h in human hepatocytes. When given orally to rats and monkeys, AT-527 preferentially delivered high levels of AT-9010 in the liver in vivo. These favorable preclinical attributes support the ongoing clinical development of AT-527 and suggest that, when used in combination with an HCV DAA from a different class, AT-527 may increase SVR rates, especially for difficult-to-treat patient populations, and could potentially shorten treatment duration for all patients.","095424c03a6e78279e47488552d961bc328f9c84","True","PLoS One","HCV|HCV|3|HCV|HCV|HCV|1–5|5–28 nM.|HCV|RNA|RNA|RNA|10-fold|SOF|HCV|1–5|S282|58-fold|SOF|100|μM.|PSI-938|PSI-661|IC(50|CYP|half|10|HCV|SVR","cc-by","","PMC6949113","31914458","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 8","","10.1371/journal.pone.0227104","comm_use_subset"

TB is a major cause of illness and death worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa. Despite the fact that TB is a curable illness, the tragedy is that TB remains the biggest killer in the world as a single pathogen. The aim of this study was to determine the experiences of nurses caring for TB patients at a regional hospital in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive designs were used. A non-probability purposive sampling method was used to select the participants. The personal experiences of six nurses with more than five years’ experience caring for TB patients at a regional hospital were explored, and it was guided by data saturation. Data were collected through in-depth individual interviews. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi’s method. Trustworthiness was ensured and ethical considerations were observed in this study. The research findings revealed six major themes from the raw data: challenges of the working environment, problems impacting on the quality of nursing care, fear, anxiety, stress and risk of contracting infection, nurses’ perceptions towards patients, support structure available in the hospital, and support needs for the nurses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address the challenges experienced by nurses caring for communicable diseases through provision of a positive practice work environment.","06f8316b5b1cd5f0737d5ada43c3dd9ebce27a91","True","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Mycobacterium|Asia|Africa|TB|TB|Limpopo Province|South Africa|six|more than five|Colaizzi|six","cc-by","","PMC6949926","31817829","GPE|LOC|LOC|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL","PMC","2019 Dec 7","","10.3390/ijerph16244977","comm_use_subset"

A combination of as yet poorly understood host and viral factors combine to cause a minority of FCoV-infected cats to develop FIP. Clinicopathological features include fever, vasculitis, and serositis, with or without effusions; all of which indicate a pro-inflammatory state with cytokine release. As a result, primary immune organs, as well as circulating leukocytes, have thus far been of most interest in previous studies to determine the likely sources of these cytokines. Results have suggested that these tissues alone may not be sufficient to induce the observed inflammation. The current study therefore focussed on the liver and heart, organs with a demonstrated ability to produce cytokines and therefore with huge potential to exacerbate inflammatory processes. The IL-12:IL-10 ratio, a marker of the immune system’s inflammatory balance, was skewed towards the pro-inflammatory IL-12 in the liver of cats with FIP. Both organs were found to upregulate mRNA expression of the inflammatory triad of cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in FIP. This amplifying step may be one of the missing links in the pathogenesis of this enigmatic disease.","d408854267a5f3330fab52531265d9a38a91e60f","True","Viruses","Feline|FIP|feline|FCoV|FCoV|FIP|Clinicopathological|IL-12:IL-10|FIP|IL-6|TNF-α|FIP","cc-by","","PMC6949997","31835559","DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 10","","10.3390/v11121144","comm_use_subset"

The virus was ultimately named Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and has been endemic in Saudi Arabia since 2012. As of September 2019, 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases with 851 associated deaths have occurred with a case fatality rate of 34.4%, according to the World Health Organization. An imported case of MERS occurred in South Korea in 2015, stimulating a multi-month outbreak. Several distinguishing factors emerge upon epidemiological and sociological analysis of the two outbreaks including public awareness of the MERS outbreak, and transmission and synchronization of governing healthcare bodies. South Korea implemented a stringent healthcare model that protected patients and healthcare workers alike through prevention and high levels of public information. In addition, many details about MERS-CoV virology, transmission, pathological progression, and even the reservoir, remain unknown. This paper aims to delineate the key differences between the two regional outbreaks from both a healthcare and personal perspective including differing hospital practices, information and public knowledge, cultural practices, and reservoirs, among others. Further details about differing emergency outbreak responses, public information, and guidelines put in place to protect hospitals and citizens could improve the outcome of future MERS outbreaks.","21823032c216c8f7e08c918373d49518c68aaab1","True","Viruses","2012|Saudi Arabia|27|Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus|Saudi Arabia|2012|September 2019|2468|851|34.4%|the World Health Organization|South Korea|2015|two|South Korea|CoV|two","cc-by","","PMC6950189","31817037","DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL","PMC","2019 Dec 3","","10.3390/v11121119","comm_use_subset"

Although TiLV segment-1 shares homology with the influenza C virus PB1 and has four conserved motifs similar to influenza A, B, and C polymerases, it is unknown whether there are other properties shared between TiLV and orthomyxovirus. In the present study, we wanted to determine whether TiLV agglutinated avian and piscine erythrocytes, and whether its replication was inhibited by lysosomotropic agents, such as ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl), as seen for orthomyxoviruses. Our findings showed that influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8 (PR8) was able to hemagglutinate turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L), and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) red blood cells (RBCs), while infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) only agglutinated Atlantic salmon, but not turkey or tilapia, RBCs. In contrast to PR8 and ISAV, TiLV did not agglutinate turkey, Atlantic salmon, or tilapia RBCs. qRT-PCR analysis showed that 30 mM NH(4)Cl, a basic lysosomotropic agent, neither inhibited nor enhanced TiLV replication in E-11 cells. There was no difference in viral quantities in the infected cells with or without NH(4)Cl treatment during virus adsorption or at 1, 2, and 3 h post-infection. Given that hemagglutinin proteins that bind RBCs also serve as ligands that bind host cells during virus entry leading to endocytosis in orthomyxoviruses, the data presented here suggest that TiLV may use mechanisms that are different from orthomyxoviruses for entry and replication in host cells. Therefore, future studies should seek to elucidate the mechanisms used by TiLV for entry into host cells and to determine its mode of replication in infected cells.","3727f751c9cf944c8e6ddf578f5644629ed50d45","True","Viruses","TiLV|RNA|Amnoonviridae|TiLV|four|TiLV|TiLV|Meleagris|Atlantic|Salmo|Nile|Oreochromis|ISAV|Atlantic|ISAV|TiLV|Atlantic|30 mM NH(4)Cl|TiLV|E-11|1|2|3|TiLV|TiLV","cc-by","","PMC6950307","31842425","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|NORP|LOC|PERSON|PERSON|NORP|ORG|LOC|ORG|ORG|LOC|MONEY|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 12","","10.3390/v11121152","comm_use_subset"

However, anthropogenic influences on the landscape and climate can change species assemblages and interactions, as well as undermine host-resilience. The cumulative result is a disturbance of bat–pathogen dynamics, which facilitate spillover events to sympatric species, and may threaten bat communities already facing synergistic stressors through ecological change. Therefore, characterisation of viral pathogens in bat communities provides important basal information to monitor and predict the emergence of diseases relevant to conservation and public health. This study used targeted molecular techniques, serological assays and next generation sequencing to characterise adenoviruses, coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses from 11 species of insectivorous bats within the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia. Phylogenetic analysis indicated complex ecological interactions including virus–host associations, cross-species infections, and multiple viral strains circulating concurrently within selected bat populations. Additionally, we describe the entire coding sequences for five alphacoronaviruses (representing four putative new species), and one novel adenovirus. Results indicate that viral burden (both prevalence and richness) is not homogeneous among species, with Chalinolobus gouldii identified as a key epidemiological element within the studied communities.","5367c37ddfee14aaa94c806703361f23e09caffd","True","Viruses","11|the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia|five|four|one|Chalinolobus","cc-by","","PMC6950384","31847282","CARDINAL|LOC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 13","","10.3390/v11121157","comm_use_subset"

However, the diagnostic process can be challenging due to the high genetic diversity and high mutation rate of PRRSV. A diagnostic method that can provide more detailed genetic information about pathogens is urgently needed. In this study, we evaluated the ability of Oxford Nanopore MinION direct RNA sequencing to generate a PRRSV whole genome sequence and detect and discriminate virus at the strain-level. A nearly full length PRRSV genome was successfully generated from raw sequence reads, achieving an accuracy of 96% after consensus genome generation. Direct RNA sequencing reliably detected the PRRSV strain present with an accuracy of 99.9% using as few as 5 raw sequencing reads and successfully differentiated multiple co-infecting strains present in a sample. In addition, PRRSV strain information was obtained from clinical samples containing 10(4) to 10(6) viral copies or more within 6 hours of sequencing. Overall, direct viral RNA sequencing followed by bioinformatic analysis proves to be a promising approach for identification of the viral strain or strains involved in clinical infections, allowing for more precise prevention and control strategies during PRRSV outbreaks.","1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406","True","Viruses","PRRSV|PRRSV|Oxford Nanopore|RNA|PRRSV|PRRSV|96%|RNA|PRRSV|99.9%|as few as 5|PRRSV|6 hours|RNA|PRRSV","cc-by","","PMC6950593","31817886","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|TIME|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 7","","10.3390/v11121132","comm_use_subset"

We investigated simultaneous outbreaks of FPL between 2014 and 2018 in Australia, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where FPL outbreaks had not been reported for several decades. Case data from 989 cats and clinical samples from additional 113 cats were obtained to determine the cause of the outbreaks and epidemiological factors involved. Most cats with FPL were shelter-housed, 9 to 10 weeks old at diagnosis, unvaccinated, had not completed a primary vaccination series or had received vaccinations noncompliant with current guidelines. Analysis of parvoviral VP2 sequence data confirmed that all FPL cases were caused by FPV and not CPV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that each of these outbreaks was caused by a distinct FPV, with two virus lineages present in eastern Australia and virus movement between different geographical locations. Viruses from the UAE outbreak formed a lineage of unknown origin. FPV vaccine virus was detected in the New Zealand cases, highlighting the difficulty of distinguishing the co-incidental shedding of vaccine virus in vaccinated cats. Inadequate vaccination coverage in shelter-housed cats was a common factor in all outbreaks, likely precipitating the multiple re-emergence of infection events.","e576c57618f99c0f5073d66ebedee4d80e910e0c","True","Viruses","Feline|FPL|FPV|CPV|FPL|between 2014 and 2018|Australia|New Zealand|the United Arab Emirates|UAE|FPL|several decades|989|113|FPL|9 to 10 weeks old|FPL|FPV|CPV|FPV|two|Australia|UAE|New Zealand","cc-by","","PMC6950618","31847268","DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE","PMC","2019 Dec 13","","10.3390/v11121155","comm_use_subset"

However, information on the on data quality and reliability of established influenza surveillance systems in Africa are limited. Such information would enable countries to assess the performance of their surveillance systems, identify shortfalls for improvement and provide evidence of data reliability for policy making and public health interventions. METHODS: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza surveillance system (ISS) in Zambia during 2011–2017 using 9 attributes: (i) data quality and completeness, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness, (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability, (viii) utility, and (ix) sustainability. Each attribute was evaluated using pre-defined indicators. For each indicator we obtained the proportion (expressed as percentage) of the outcome of interest over the total. A scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each attribute as follows: < 60% (as obtained in the calculation above) scored 1 (weak performance); 60–79% scored 2 (moderate performance); ≥80% scored 3 (good performance). An overall score for each attribute and the ISS was obtained by averaging the scores of all evaluated attributes. RESULTS: The overall mean score for the ISS in Zambia was 2.6. Key strengths of the system were the quality of data generated (score: 2.9), its flexibility (score: 3.0) especially to monitor viral pathogens other than influenza viruses, its simplicity (score: 2.8), acceptability (score: 3.0) and stability (score: 2.6) over the review period and its relatively low cost ($310,000 per annum). Identified weaknesses related mainly to geographic representativeness (score: 2.0), timeliness (score: 2.5), especially in shipment of samples from remote sites, and sustainability (score: 1.0) in the absence of external funds. CONCLUSIONS: The system performed moderately well in our evaluation. Key improvements would include improvements in the timeliness of samples shipments and geographical coverage. However, these improvements would result in increased cost and logistical complexity. The ISSS in Zambia is largely reliant on external funds and the acceptability of maintaining the surveillance system through national funds would require evaluation.","9998f6aa94bb384f3a93381c404f85506d2a8f7d","True","BMC Health Serv Res","the past decade|African|Zambia|Africa|the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Zambia|9|1 to 3|60%|1|60–79%|2|≥80%|3|Zambia|2.6|2.9|3.0|2.8|3.0|2.6|310,000|2.0|2.5|1.0|ISSS|Zambia","cc-by","","PMC6958603","31931793","DATE|NORP|GPE|LOC|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE","PMC","2020 Jan 13","","10.1186/s12913-019-4884-5","comm_use_subset"

First, nine predicted PRRSV peptides were tested by assembly of the peptide-SLA-1(*)1502 (pSLA-1(*)1502) complexes, and the crystal structure of the SLA-1(*)1502 complex with one peptide (NSP9-TMP9) was determined. The NSP9-TMP9 peptide conformation presented by pSLA-1(*)1502 is different from that of the peptides presented by the known pSLA-1(*)0401 and pSLA-3(*)hs0202 complexes. Two consecutive Pro residues make the turn between P3 and P4 of NSP9-TMP9 much sharper. The D pocket of pSLA-1(*)1502 is unique and is important for peptide binding. Next, the potential SLA-1(*)1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching four typical genetic PRRSV strains were identified based on the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1(*)1502 determined by structural analysis and alanine scanning of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide. The tetrameric complex of SLA-1(*)1502 and NSP9-TMP9 was constructed and examined. Finally, taking NSP9-TMP9 as an example, the CTL immunogenicity of the identified PRRSV peptide epitope was evaluated. The SPF swine expressing the SLA-1(*)1502 alleles were divided into three groups: modified live vaccine (MLV), MLV+NSP9-TMP9, and the blank control group. NSP9-TMP9 was determined as a PRRSV CTL epitope with strong immunogenicity by flow cytometry and IFN-γ expression. Our study developed an integrated approach to identify SLA-I-restricted CTL epitopes from various important viruses and is helpful in designing and applying effective peptide-based vaccines for swine.","78b06344bf1d834407a41bceb4999839085b0082","True","Front Immunol","CTL|PRRSV|SPF|First|nine|PRRSV|pSLA-1(*)1502|SLA-1(*)1502|one|NSP9-TMP9|pSLA-1(*)1502|Two|Pro|P3|NSP9-TMP9|pSLA-1(*)1502|four|PRRSV|NSP9-TMP9|NSP9-TMP9|CTL|PRRSV|SPF|three|PRRSV CTL|IFN-γ|SLA|CTL","cc-by","","PMC6960135","31969884","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|LOC|GPE|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|NORP|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 8","","10.3389/fimmu.2019.02995","comm_use_subset"

An efficient vaccine for the prophylaxis of humans in hotspots of the infection (e.g., Saudi Arabia) is necessary but no commercial vaccines are yet approved. In this study, a chimeric DNA construct was designed to encode an influenza A/H1N1 NA protein which is flanking immunogenic amino acids (aa) 736–761 of MERS-CoV spike protein. Using the generated chimeric construct, a novel recombinant vaccine strain against pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09) and MERS-CoV was generated (chimeric bivalent 5 + 3). The chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 vaccine strain comprises a recombinant PR8-based vaccine, expressing the PB1, HA, and chimeric NA of pandemic 2009 H1N1. Interestingly, an increase in replication efficiency of the generated vaccine strain was observed when compared to the PR8-based 5 + 3 H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain that lacks the MERS-CoV spike peptide insert. In BALB/c mice, the inactivated chimeric bivalent vaccine induced potent and specific neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV and H1N1pdm09. This novel approach succeeded in developing a recombinant influenza virus with potential use as a bivalent vaccine against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV. This approach provides a basis for the future development of chimeric influenza-based vaccines against MERS-CoV and other viruses.","02a29bd2f39ecdbbb5e51a003c0bc7818029f384","True","Pathogens","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus|first|2012|Saudi Arabia|CoV|H1N1pdm09|CoV|5|3|5|3|NA|2009|H1N1|5|H1N1pdm09|CoV|BALB|CoV|H1N1pdm09|H1N1pdm09|MERS-CoV.","cc-by","","PMC6963271","31810359","ORG|ORDINAL|DATE|GPE|PERSON|FAC|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|GPE|GPE|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 2","","10.3390/pathogens8040281","comm_use_subset"

Intracellular cholesterol accumulation was reported to disrupt late endosome function. Based on these findings, types I and II FCoV are considered to enter the cytosol through late and early endosomes, respectively. We investigated whether the antiviral activities of a late endosome trafficking inhibitor and cholesterol-accumulating agents are different between the FCoV serotypes. The late endosome trafficking inhibitor did not inhibit type II FCoV infection, but it inhibited type I FCoV infection. Type I FCoV infection was inhibited by cholesterol-accumulating triazoles, but not by non-cholesterol-accumulating triazoles. These phenomena were observed in both feline cell lines and feline primary macrophages.

The more recent ZIKV outbreaks in the Americas and the Caribbean associated with congenital malformations and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults have placed public health officials in high alert and highlight the significant impact of ZIKV on human health. New technologies to study the biology of ZIKV and to develop more effective prevention options are highly desired. In this study we demonstrate that direct delivery in mice of an infectious ZIKV cDNA clone allows the rescue of recombinant (r)ZIKV in vivo. A bacterial artificial chromosome containing the sequence of ZIKV strain Paraiba/2015 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was complexed with a commercial transfection reagent and administrated using different routes in type-I interferon receptor deficient A129 mice. Clinical signs and death associated with ZIKV viremia were observed in mice. The rZIKV recovered from these mice remained fully virulent in a second passage in mice. Interestingly, infectious rZIKV was also recovered after intraperitoneal inoculation of the rZIKV cDNA in the absence of transfection reagent. Further expanding these studies, we demonstrate that a single intraperitoneal inoculation of a cDNA clone encoding an attenuated rZIKV was safe, highly immunogenic, and provided full protection against lethal ZIKV challenge. This novel in vivo reverse genetics method is a potentially suitable delivery platform for the study of wild-type and live-attenuated ZIKV devoid of confounding factors typical associated with in vitro systems. Moreover, our results open the possibility of employing similar in vivo reverse genetic approaches for the generation of other viruses and, therefore, change the way we will use reverse genetics in the future.","185e505daa1da8ee7ece18212693b2550410a190","True","Sci Rep","ZIKV|Flaviviridae|decades|ZIKV|Americas|Caribbean|Guillain-Barré|ZIKV|ZIKV|ZIKV|ZIKV|ZIKV|second|ZIKV|ZIKV","cc-by","","PMC6965646","31949262","PERSON|GPE|DATE|PERSON|LOC|LOC|LAW|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORDINAL|PERSON|PERSON","PMC","2020 Jan 16","","10.1038/s41598-020-57545-2","comm_use_subset"

Antibodies to the ZIKV envelope (E) protein can block infection. In this study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) mRNA transcripts was combined with single-cell PCR cloning of E-binding monoclonal antibodies for analysing antibody response in a patient from the early stages of infection to more than one year after the clearance of the virus. The patient's IgH repertoire 14 and 64 days after symptom onset showed dramatic dominant clonal expansion but low clonal diversity. IgH repertoire 6 months after disease-free status had few dominant clones but increased diversity. E-binding antibodies appeared abundantly in the repertoire during the early stages of infection but quickly declined after clearance of the virus. Certain VH genes such as VH5-10-1 and VH4-39 appeared to be preferentially enlisted for a rapid antibody response to ZIKV infection. Most of these antibodies require relatively few somatic hypermutations to acquire the ability to bind to the E protein, pointing to a possible mechanism for rapid defence against ZIKV infection. This study provides a unique and holistic view of the dynamic changes and characteristics of the antibody response to ZIKV infection.","f0f89b444071b6fa4be64b86e5d70a4cab8cb492","True","Emerg Microbes Infect","Zika|ZIKV|ZIKV|IgH|more than one year|IgH|14 and 64 days|IgH|6 months|VH|VH5-10-1|ZIKV|ZIKV|ZIKV","cc-by","","PMC6968589","31906823","PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON","PMC","2020 Jan 6","","10.1080/22221751.2019.1701953","comm_use_subset"

Despite widespread outbreaks in many countries, no effective PDCoV vaccines are currently available. Here, we generated, for the first time, a full-length infectious cDNA clone of PDCoV. We further manipulated the infectious clone by replacing the NS6 gene with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to generate rPDCoV-ΔNS6-GFP; likewise, rPDCoV-ΔNS7 was constructed by removing the ATG start codons of the NS7 gene. Growth kinetics studies suggest that rPDCoV-ΔNS7 could replicate similarly to that of the wild-type PDCoV, whereas rPDCoV-ΔNS6-GFP exhibited a substantial reduction of viral titer in vitro and in vivo. Piglets inoculated with rPDCoV-ΔNS7 or wild-type PDCoV showed similar diarrheic scores and pathological injury. In contrast, rPDCoV-ΔNS6-GFP-infected piglets did not show any clinical signs, indicating that the NS6 protein is an important virulence factor of PDCoV and that the NS6-deficient mutant virus might be a promising live-attenuated vaccine candidate.

Diagnosis of the virus responsible for disease is essential to ensure patients receive appropriate clinical management. Very few real-time RT-PCR based assays are able to detect the presence of all members of these families using a single primer and probe set. We have developed a novel chemistry, 3base, which simplifies the viral nucleic acids allowing the design of RT-PCR assays capable of pan-family identification. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Synthetic constructs, viral nucleic acids, intact viral particles and characterised reference materials were used to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the assays. Synthetic constructs demonstrated the sensitivities of the pan-flavivirus detection component were in the range of 13 copies per PCR. The pan-alphavirus assay had a sensitivity range of 10–25 copies per reaction depending on the viral strain. Lower limit of detection studies using whole virus particles demonstrated that sensitivity for assays was in the range of 1–2 copies per reaction. No cross reactivity was observed with a number of commonly encountered viral strains. Proficiency panels showed 100% concordance with the expected results and the assays performed as well as, if not better than, other assays used in laboratories worldwide. After initial assay validation the pan-viral assays were then tested during the 2016–2017 Vanuatu dengue-2 outbreak. Positive results were detected in 116 positives from a total of 187 suspected dengue samples. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The pan-viral screening assays described here utilise a novel 3base technology and are shown to provide a sensitive and specific method to screen and thereafter speciate flavi- and/or alpha- viruses in clinical samples.

Apart from bacterial infections, paramyxo-, adeno-, reo- and arenaviruses cause these diseases. In 2014, new viruses emerged as the cause of pneumonia in pythons. In a few publications, nidoviruses have been reported in association with pneumonia in ball pythons and a tiger python. The viruses were found using new sequencing methods from the organ tissue of dead animals. METHODS: Severe pneumonia and stomatitis resulted in a high mortality rate in a captive breeding collection of green tree pythons. Unbiased deep sequencing lead to the detection of nidoviral sequences. A developed RT-qPCR was used to confirm the metagenome results and to determine the importance of this virus. A total of 1554 different boid snakes, including animals suffering from respiratory diseases as well as healthy controls, were screened for nidoviruses. Furthermore, in addition to two full-length sequences, partial sequences were generated from different snake species. RESULTS: The assembled full-length snake nidovirus genomes share only an overall genome sequence identity of less than 66.9% to other published snake nidoviruses and new partial sequences vary between 99.89 and 79.4%. Highest viral loads were detected in lung samples. The snake nidovirus was not only present in diseased animals, but also in snakes showing no typical clinical signs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further highlight the possible importance of snake nidoviruses in respiratory diseases and proof multiple circulating strains with varying disease potential. Nidovirus detection in clinical healthy individuals might represent testing during the incubation period or reconvalescence. Our investigations show new aspects of nidovirus infections in pythons. Nidoviruses should be included in routine diagnostic workup of diseased reptiles.","d8d17ed0a635b0771ab27b88b15e868759b1dfb2","True","Virol J","Pneumonia|2014|Severe|Unbiased|RT-qPCR|1554|two|less than 66.9%|79.4%|Highest","cc-by","","PMC6969405","31952524","GPE|DATE|NORP|PERSON|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 17","","10.1186/s12985-020-1279-5","comm_use_subset"
"Nieuwoudt, I.; Goussard, P.; Verster, J.; Dempers, J.","Tonsillar hypertrophy and prolapse in a child – is epiglottitis a predisposing factor for sudden unexpected death?","BACKGROUND: Tonsillitis, with associated tonsillar hypertrophy, is a common disease of childhood, yet it is rarely associated with sudden death due to airway obstruction. Lethal complications involving the inflamed tonsils include haemorrhage, retropharyngeal abscess and disseminated sepsis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a case of sudden and unexpected death in an 8-year-old female who was diagnosed with and treated for tonsillitis. The child was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis 2 days prior to her collapse and was placed on a course of oral antibiotics. There were no signs of upper or lower airway obstruction. She was found to be unresponsive by her caregiver and gasping for air in her bed in the early hours of the second morning after the start of treatment. Autopsy showed massive and symmetrically enlarged palatine tonsils. The tonsils filled the pharynx almost completely. The epiglottis and laryngeal mucosa at the base of the epiglottis in the vicinity of the aryepiglottic membrane and the superior aspect of the larynx displayed red-purple discoloration, with mucosal swelling and edema. Histological examination of the palatine tonsils revealed prominent lymphoid hyperplasia, but no evidence of acute inflammation. CONCLUSION: Palatine tonsillar hypertrophy in infants is a common feature of both viral and bacterial tonsillitis and has been postulated as a possible risk factor for Sudden and Unexplained Death in Infancy (SUDI), based on the theory of mechanical impediment of breathing by narrowing of the upper airway. The rounded shape of the tonsils may facilitate some airflow past the enlarged structures and hence protect against asphyxial death when the enlarged tonsils fill the laryngo-pharynx. Epiglottal and proximal laryngeal edema may play a more significant role in asphyxial unexpected deaths in cases of tonsillitis with tonsillar hypertrophy than previously suspected. This focusses the importance of careful examination of the epiglottis and proximal laryngeal mucosa, as part of a thorough examination of the laryngo-pharynx in cases of sudden death associated with tonsillar hypertrophy.","faac6cddc8f0126d5f93e948689eead41f54ad1f","True","BMC Pediatr","Tonsillitis|8-year-old|2 days|the early hours of the second morning|Autopsy|Palatine|Sudden","cc-by","","PMC6970282","31959132","ORG|DATE|DATE|TIME|PERSON|PERSON|GPE","PMC","2020 Jan 20","","10.1186/s12887-020-1927-3","comm_use_subset"

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we found that TGEV infection severely disrupted intestinal homeostasis via inhibition of self-renewal and differentiation in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Profoundly, TGEV-encoded NSP10/NSP16 protein complex-mediated the inactivation of Notch signaling provided a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Initial invasions by TGEV-targeted Paneth cells through aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor, then inducing mitochondrial damage and ROS generation in them, ultimately causing Paneth cell decrease and loss of Notch factors (DII4 and Hes5), which are essential for Lgr5 ISCs self-renewal and differentiation. Interestingly, loss of Notch signaling induced goblet cells differentiation at the cost of absorptive enterocytes and promoted mucins secretion, which accelerated TGEV replication. Therefore, the more differentiation of goblet cells, the greater TGEV infection in jejunum. These results provide a detailed mechanistic pathway by which villous atrophy sharply occurs in TGEV-infected jejunum within 48 h. Thus, the pathogenesis of TGEV can be described as a “bottom up scenario”, which is contrary to the traditional “top down” hypothesis. Together, our findings provide a potential link between diarrheal virus infection and crypt cells response that regulates Paneth cells function and Lgr5 ISCs fate and could be exploited for therapeutic application.","486ad1536fb8f8a3ac0f4a38ee97fc8af2435cc0","True","Cell Death Dis","TGEV|48|TGEV|TGEV|Notch|TGEV|Paneth|APN|Paneth|Notch|Notch|TGEV|TGEV|TGEV|48 h.|TGEV|Paneth","cc-by","","PMC6971083","31959773","ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERSON|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|QUANTITY|ORG|GPE","PMC","2020 Jan 20","","10.1038/s41419-020-2233-6","comm_use_subset"

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-related proteins are essential in ZIKV genome replication. This review highlights the subcellular localization of ZIKV to the ER and ZIKV modulation on the architecture of the ER. This review also discusses ZIKV interaction with ER proteins such as signal peptidase complex subunit 1 (SPCS1), ER membrane complex (EMC) subunits, and ER translocon for viral replication. Furthermore, the review covers several important resulting effects of ZIKV infection to the ER and cellular processes including ER stress, reticulophagy, and paraptosis-like death. Pharmacological targeting of ZIKV-affected ER-resident proteins and ER-associated components demonstrate promising signs of combating ZIKV infection and rescuing host organisms from severe neurologic sequelae.","c7c6c6ff7580f79ffba12017575ac3ccca4bc9b7","True","J Biomed Sci","ZIKV|Flavivirus|Flaviviridae|ZIKV|ZIKV|ZIKV|ZIKV|ZIKV|1|SPCS1|EMC|ZIKV|ZIKV-affected|ZIKV","cc-by","","PMC6971992","31959174","PERSON|PERSON|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON","PMC","2020 Jan 20","","10.1186/s12929-020-0618-6","comm_use_subset"

Y.","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Antibodies in Bactrian and Hybrid Camels from Dubai","So far, dromedary camels are the only known animal reservoir for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Previous published serological studies showed that sera of Bactrian camels were all negative for MERS-CoV antibodies. However, a recent study revealed that direct inoculation of Bactrian camels intranasally with MERS-CoV can lead to infection with abundant virus shedding and seroconversion. In this study, we examined the presence of MERS-CoV antibodies in Bactrian and hybrid camels in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (where dromedaries are also present), and Bactrian camels in Xinjiang, China (where dromedaries are absent). For the 29 serum samples from Bactrian camels in Dubai tested by the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (S-ELISA) and neutralization antibody test, 14 (48%) and 12 (41%), respectively, were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies. All the 12 serum samples that were positive with the neutralization antibody test were also positive for the S-ELISA. For the 11 sera from hybrid camels in Dubai tested with the S-ELISA and neutralization antibody test, 6 (55%) and 9 (82%), respectively, were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies. All the 6 serum samples that were positive for the S-ELISA were also positive with the neutralization antibody test. There was a strong correlation between the antibody levels detected by S-ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers, with a Spearman coefficient of 0.6262 (P < 0.0001; 95% confidence interval, 0.5062 to 0.7225). All 92 Bactrian camel serum samples from Xinjiang were negative for MERS-CoV antibodies tested using both S-ELISA and the neutralization antibody test. Bactrian and hybrid camels are potential sources of MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Since its first appearance in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has affected >25 countries, with >2,400 cases and an extremely high fatality rate of >30%. The total number of mortalities due to MERS is already greater than that due to severe acute respiratory syndrome. MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been confirmed to be the etiological agent. So far, dromedaries are the only known animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. Previously published serological studies showed that sera of Bactrian camels were all negative for MERS-CoV antibodies. In this study, we observed that 41% of the Bactrian camel sera and 55% of the hybrid camel sera from Dubai (where dromedaries are also present), but none of the sera from Bactrian camels in Xinjiang (where dromedaries are absent), were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies. Based on these results, we conclude that in addition to dromedaries, Bactrian and hybrid camels are also potential sources of MERS-CoV infection.","036bbd8c099c5721274abb4067872f2a68b6193a","True","mSphere","Middle East|Bactrian|CoV|Bactrian|CoV|CoV|Bactrian|Dubai|the United Arab Emirates|Bactrian|Xinjiang|China|29|Bactrian|Dubai|enzyme|S-ELISA|14|48%|12|41%|CoV|12|the S-ELISA|11|Dubai|the S-ELISA|6|55%|9 (82%|CoV|6|the S-ELISA|S-ELISA|Spearman|0.6262|0.0001|95%|0.5062|0.7225|92|Bactrian|Xinjiang|CoV|both S-ELISA|Bactrian|CoV|IMPORTANCE|first|2012|Middle East|25|2,400|>30%|Bactrian|CoV|41%|Bactrian|55%|Dubai|Bactrian|Xinjiang|CoV|Bactrian|CoV","cc-by","","PMC6977179","31969478","LOC|NORP|PERSON|NORP|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|QUANTITY|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|CARDINAL|FAC|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|CARDINAL|FAC|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|PERSON|PRODUCT|NORP|PERSON|PERSON|ORDINAL|DATE|LOC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|NORP|PERSON|PERCENT|NORP|PERCENT|GPE|NORP|GPE|PERSON|NORP|PERSON","PMC","2020 Jan 22","","10.1128/mSphere.00898-19","comm_use_subset"

Therefore, the factors related to self-isolation (SI) should not be neglected, and it is important to investigate the factors leading the infected (or possibly infected) people to choose to self-isolate. In this paper, we tried to show that the theory of planned behavior provides a useful conceptual framework for SI when facing a pandemic risk, and a regression method with Chinese provincial (Guangdong Province) data was applied to investigate how attitude (ATT), subjective norms (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC) influence SI when facing a pandemic emergency. The results and the robustness tests confirm that ATT, SN, and PBC have a significant positive influence on SI when facing a pandemic emergency. ATT plays the most important role, followed by SN and then PBC.

Redox imbalance and excessive release of inflammatory mediators have been intricately linked in obesity-associated phenotypes. Hence, understanding the mechanisms of redox signaling pathways and molecular targets exacerbating oxidative stress is crucial in improving health outcomes. The activation of Na/K-ATPase/Src signaling, and its downstream pathways, by reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been recently implicated in obesity and subsequent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which causes further production of ROS creating an oxidant amplification loop. Apart from that, numerous studies have also characterized antioxidant properties of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), which is suppressed in an obese state. The induction of HO-1 restores cellular redox processes, which contributes to inhibition of the toxic milieu. The novelty of these independent mechanisms presents a unique opportunity to unravel their potential as molecular targets for redox regulation in obesity and NASH. The attenuation of oxidative stress, by understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms and associated mediators, with a targeted treatment modality may provide for improved therapeutic options to combat clinical disorders.","3c7d045c73a10e8b81cc58d86d7cf5d144f83b1b","True","Int J Mol Sci","Redox|Na/K-ATPase/Src|NASH|ROS|1|HO-1|NASH","cc-by","","PMC6982200","31877680","PERSON|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 21","","10.3390/ijms21010087","comm_use_subset"

This observation supported the importance of non-coding RNAs and it was confirmed in several organisms. The most abundant non-translated transcripts are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In contrast to protein-coding RNAs, they show a more cell-specific expression. To understand the function of lncRNAs, it is fundamental to investigate in which cells they are preferentially expressed and to detect their subcellular localization. Recent improvements of techniques that localize single RNA molecules in tissues like single-cell RNA sequencing and fluorescence amplification methods have given a considerable boost in the knowledge of the lncRNA functions. In recent years, single-cell transcription variability was associated with non-coding RNA expression, revealing this class of RNAs as important transcripts in the cell lineage specification. The purpose of this review is to collect updated information about lncRNA classification and new findings on their function derived from single-cell analysis. We also retained useful for all researchers to describe the methods available for single-cell analysis and the databases collecting single-cell and lncRNA data.

Aptamers are short single-stranded RNA or DNA oligonucleotides capable of folding into complex 3D structures, enabling them to bind to a large variety of targets ranging from small ions to an entire organism. Their high binding specificity and affinity make them comparable to antibodies, but they are superior regarding a longer shelf life, simple production and chemical modification, in addition to low toxicity and immunogenicity. In the past three decades, aptamers have been used in a plethora of therapeutics and drug delivery systems that involve innovative delivery mechanisms and carrying various types of drug cargos. However, the successful translation of aptamer research from bench to bedside has been challenged by several limitations that slow down the realization of promising aptamer applications as therapeutics at the clinical level. The main limitations include the susceptibility to degradation by nucleases, fast renal clearance, low thermal stability, and the limited functional group diversity. The solution to overcome such limitations lies in the chemistry of aptamers. The current review will focus on the recent arts of aptamer chemistry that have been evolved to refine the pharmacological properties of aptamers. Moreover, this review will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of such chemical modifications and how they impact the pharmacological properties of aptamers. Finally, this review will summarize the conjugation strategies of aptamers to nanocarriers for developing targeted drug delivery systems.","aefeb0e9f2d0db1868113232cdb87597e7614068","True","Molecules","1990|RNA|the past three decades","cc-by","","PMC6982925","31861277","DATE|ORG|DATE","PMC","2019 Dec 18","","10.3390/molecules25010003","comm_use_subset"

This high-risk group of infection was previously identified by conducting large-scale visits/interviews, or manually screening among tons of recorded surveillance videos. Both are time-intensive and most likely to delay the control of communicable diseases like influenza. In this paper, we address this challenge by solving a multi-tasking problem from the captured surveillance videos. This multi-tasking framework aims to model the principle of Close Proximity Interaction and thus infer the infection risk of individuals. The complete workflow includes three essential sub-tasks: (1) person re-identification (REID), to identify the diagnosed patient and infected individuals across different cameras, (2) depth estimation, to provide a spatial knowledge of the captured environment, (3) pose estimation, to evaluate the distance between the diagnosed and potentially-infected subjects. Our method significantly reduces the time and labor costs. We demonstrate the advantages of high accuracy and efficiency of our method. Our method is expected to be effective in accelerating the process of identifying the potentially infected group and ultimately contribute to the well-being of public health.","f261de4ce70f551ec9bdc573256bef4a61f43174","True","Front Neurorobot","Close Proximity Interaction|three|1|REID|2|3","cc-by","","PMC6985151","32038220","ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","PMC","2020 Jan 21","","10.3389/fnbot.2019.00113","comm_use_subset"

First, mPSCs and its immortalized cell line mPSCs(Oct4+) were shown to be susceptible to PR8, seasonal H1N1, 2009 pandemic H1N1, and H7N9 influenza viruses and can generate infectious virus particles, although with a lower virus titer, which could be attributed by the reduced vRNA replication and nucleoprotein (NP) aggregation in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, a significant increase of interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-γ at 12 h and IFN-β at 24 h post infection in mPSCs implicates that mPSCs might function as a sensor to modulate immune responses to influenza virus infection.

"Jiménez Fernández, Daniel; Hess, Sandra; Knobeloch, Klaus-Peter","Strategies to Target ISG15 and USP18 Toward Therapeutic Applications","The interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) represents an ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl), which in a process termed ISGylation can be covalently linked to target substrates via a cascade of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. Furthermore, ISG15 exerts functions in its free form both, as an intracellular and as a secreted protein. In agreement with its role as a type I IFN effector, most functions of ISG15 and ISGylation are linked to the anti-pathogenic response. However, also key roles in other cellular processes such as protein translation, cytoskeleton dynamics, exosome secretion, autophagy or genome stability and cancer were described. Ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18) constitutes the major ISG15 specific protease which counteracts ISG15 conjugation. Remarkably, USP18 also functions as a critical negative regulator of the IFN response irrespective of its enzymatic activity. Concordantly, lack of USP18 function causes fatal interferonopathies in humans and mice. The negative regulatory function of USP18 in IFN signaling is regulated by various protein–protein interactions and its stability is controlled via proteasomal degradation. The broad repertoire of physiological functions and regulation of ISG15 and USP18 offers a variety of potential intervention strategies which might be of therapeutic use. Due to the high mutation rates of pathogens which are often species specific and constantly give rise to a variety of immune evasion mechanisms, immune effector systems are under constant evolutionarily pressure. Therefore, it is not surprising that considerable differences in ISG15 with respect to function and sequence exist even among closely related species. Hence, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate the translational potential of results obtained in model organisms especially for therapeutic strategies. This review covers existing and conceptual assay systems to target and identify modulators of ISG15, ISGylation, USP18 function, and protein–protein interactions within this context. Strategies comprise mouse models for translational perspectives, cell-based and biochemical assays as well as chemical probes.","b0ece8ef777c5e15e41c4140cb6be2a8944af191","True","Front Chem","15|E1|E2|ISGylation|anti-pathogenic|Ubiquitin|18|USP18|USP18|IFN|USP18|USP18|IFN|USP18|ISGylation|USP18","cc-by","","PMC6985271","32039148","CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 21","","10.3389/fchem.2019.00923","comm_use_subset"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 359 serum samples were collected from 55 backyard chickens and tested using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits to determine the seroprevalence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), influenza type A, Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS). Molecular prevalence of NDV, IBV, low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H9N2, MG, and MS was carried out on swab, and tissue samples collected from 55 backyard flocks and 11 commercial broiler flocks suffered from respiratory infections using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: Seroprevalence of NDV, IBV, Influenza type A virus, MG, and MS in chicken backyard flocks was 56.4%, 50.9%, 12.7%, 14.5%, and 3.6%, respectively. Specific antibodies against one or more respiratory viruses and mycoplasma were detected in 36.4% of backyard flocks, indicating concurrent viral infections. The molecular survey showed that 90.9% of chicken backyard flocks were infected with common respiratory viruses (NDV, IBV, and LPAIV H9N2) while 81.8% of commercial broiler flocks were infected. The molecular prevalence rate of NDV, IBV, and LPAIV H9N2 was 46.97%, 56.1%, and 19.7% in backyard flocks, respectively. Combined viral and bacterial infection represented 40% and 63.6% of the respiratory infections, resulting in enhanced pathogenicity and increased mortalities of up to 87.5% and 27.8% in backyard and commercial flocks, respectively. Mixed infection of IBV, LPAIV H9N2, and/or Escherichia coli is the most prevalent mixed infection in broiler flocks, inducing severe clinical outcomes. Avian pathogenic E. coli was, respectively, isolated from 40% of backyard flocks and 81.82% of broiler flocks. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from three backyard chicken flocks mixed with other respiratory pathogens with elevated mortality. Mixed infection of E. coli and MG reported in 9.1% of broiler flock. MG was detected in 14.5% of backyard flocks and 9.1% of broiler flocks while MS was detected only in 3.6% of backyard chickens mixed with E. coli, and other viruses. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that mixed infections are more commonly prevalent and associated with dramatic exacerbation in clinical outcomes than a single infection. Bidirectional synergistic interaction between these concurrently interacted respiratory pathogens explains the severe clinical impact and high mortality rate. The high prevalence of IBV (either as a single or combined infection) with LPAIV H9N2 and/or E. coli, in spite of intensive use of commercial vaccines, increases the need for revising vaccination programs and the application of standard biosecurity measures. Backyard chickens impose a great risk and threaten commercial flocks due to the high prevalence of viral respiratory pathogens.","570259cab68c41a50bbfd4c998042c397bc8af33","True","Vet World","359|55|Newcastle|NDV|IBV|Mycoplasma|MG|Mycoplasma|NDV|IBV|LPAIV|H9N2|MG|55|11|NDV|IBV|Influenza|MG|56.4%|50.9%|12.7%|14.5%|3.6%|one|36.4%|90.9%|NDV|IBV|LPAIV H9N2|81.8%|NDV|IBV|LPAIV H9N2|46.97%|56.1%|19.7%|40%|63.6%|up to 87.5%|27.8%|IBV|LPAIV H9N2|Escherichia|Avian|pathogenic E. coli|40%|81.82%|three|MG|9.1%|MG|14.5%|9.1%|3.6%|IBV|LPAIV H9N2 and/or E. coli|Backyard","cc-by","","PMC6989313","32095050","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERSON|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 16","","10.14202/vetworld.2019.1975-1986","comm_use_subset"

The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the only IgG transport receptor, its expression on mucosal surfaces is triggered upon viral stimulation, which significantly enhances mucosal immunity. We utilized TGEV as a model pathogen to explore the role of FcRn in resisting viral invasion in overall intestinal mucosal immunity. TGEV induced FcRn expression by activating NF-κB signaling in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. First, using small interfering RNAs, we found that TGEV up-regulated FcRn expression via TLR3, TLR9 and RIG-I. Moreover, TGEV induced IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β, and TNF-α production. TGF-β-stimulated IPEC-J2 cells highly up-regulated FcRn expression, while treatment with a JNK-specific inhibitor down-regulated the expression. TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein also enhanced FcRn promoter activity via the NF-κB signaling pathway and its central region (aa 128–252) was essential for FcRn activation. Additionally, N protein-mediated FcRn up-regulation promotes IgG transcytosis. Thus, TGEV N protein and TGF-β up-regulated FcRn expression, further clarifying the molecular mechanism of up-regulation of FcRn expression by TGEV.","be5a6b0a0bff9b130578c5ad71a6be32d16525d6","True","Front Microbiol","TGEV|Fc|FcRn|IgG|TGEV|FcRn|TGEV|FcRn|NF-κB|IPEC-J2|First|TGEV|FcRn|RIG|TGEV|IL-6|IL-8|TGF-β|TNF-α|IPEC-J2|FcRn|JNK|TGEV|FcRn|NF-κB|FcRn|N|FcRn|IgG|TGEV|TGF-β|FcRn|FcRn|TGEV","cc-by","","PMC6990134","32038538","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|LOC|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|LOC|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 21","","10.3389/fmicb.2019.03085","comm_use_subset"

However, the dual burden of infectious and chronic diseases remains a challenge with respect to achieving the health target in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for sustainable development goals (SDGs). In 2015, about 44% of the poor population in China were impoverished by illness but already in 2018, multi-sectoral actions delivered by the Health-related Poverty Alleviation programme had reduced the number almost by half. In the past three years 15 million poor people (98% of the poor population) with infectious and chronic diseases had been treated and taken care of thanks to financial support through multiple health insurance schemes and other governmental subsidies. This article discusses the lessons learnt with regard to health-related poverty alleviation in China with special reference to those still remaining impoverished by illness. Consolidation of the achievements reached and provision of basic needs to those still disadvantaged and in poor health will require a major improvement of accessibility to, and affordability of, health services. The next step towards enhanced productivity and better living conditions will involve upgrading of the capacity of health professionals in the poor regions, promotion of coherent efforts in health-related poverty alleviation and rural revitalization measures. As an additional measure, data monitoring and research on health poverty alleviation should be strengthened as they are essential to generate the evidence and knowledge needed to support the move in the direction envisioned by the SDGs, and the new Healthy China 2030 programme.","7bd92243bc19bc49fe89f6dc278614adf8cbdf4b","True","Infect Dis Poverty","five-year|the Chinese Government|more than 70 million|the year 2020|China|the United Nations|SDGs|2015|about 44%|China|2018|half|the past three years 15 million|98%|China|SDGs|Healthy|China|2030","cc-by","","PMC6990531","31996258","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|ORG|PERSON|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|DATE","PMC","2020 Jan 30","","10.1186/s40249-020-0626-5","comm_use_subset"

The discovery of these new medicines has been driven primarily by new approaches in inflammatory diseases and oncology, especially in immuno-oncology. Other recent successes have included new antibodies for use in viral diseases, including HIV. The perception of very high costs associated with mAbs has led to the assumption that they play no role in prophylaxis for diseases of poverty. However, improvements in antibody-expression yields and manufacturing processes indicate this is a cost-effective option for providing protection from many types of infection that should be revisited. Recent technology developments also indicate that several months of protection could be achieved with a single dose. Moreover, new methods in B cell sorting now enable the systematic identification of high-quality antibodies from humanized mice, or patients.

"Li, Bei; Si, Hao-Rui; Zhu, Yan; Yang, Xing-Lou; Anderson, Danielle E.; Shi, Zheng-Li; Wang, Lin-Fa; Zhou, Peng","Discovery of Bat Coronaviruses through Surveillance and Probe Capture-Based Next-Generation Sequencing","Coronaviruses (CoVs) of bat origin have caused two pandemics in this century. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV both originated from bats, and it is highly likely that bat coronaviruses will cause future outbreaks. Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of these viruses in humans. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is currently the preferred methodology for virus discovery to ensure unbiased sequencing of bat CoVs, considering their high genetic diversity. However, unbiased NGS is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences due to the high background level of nonviral sequences present in surveillance field samples. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting most of the CoV species. Using this technology, we effectively reduced sequencing costs by increasing the sensitivity of detection. We discovered nine full genomes of bat CoVs in this study and revealed great genetic diversity for eight of them. IMPORTANCE Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of bat-origin CoV in humans and livestock. However, great genetic diversity increases the chance of homologous recombination among CoVs. Performing targeted PCR, a common practice for many surveillance studies, would not reflect this diversity. NGS, on the other hand, is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting all CoVs. Our work demonstrates that targeted, cost-effective, large-scale, genome-level surveillance of bat CoVs is now highly feasible.","c2952e4d56bd9bf5c6eee0aaa733557471e60a92","True","mSphere","two|this century|SARS)-CoV|Middle East|NGS|CoV|NGS|CoV|eight|IMPORTANCE Active|CoV|CoV|NGS","cc-by","","PMC6992374","31996413","CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|LOC|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 29","","10.1128/mSphere.00807-19","comm_use_subset"

The recently characterized E protein ion channel activity (EIC) has also been implicated in modulating viral pathogenesis. In this study, we used infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) as a model to study EIC. Two recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) harboring EIC-inactivating mutations – rT16A and rA26F – were serially passaged, and several compensatory mutations were identified in the transmembrane domain (TMD). Two rIBVs harboring these putative EIC-reverting mutations – rT16A/A26V and rA26F/F14N – were recovered. Compared with the parental rIBV-p65 control, all four EIC mutants exhibited comparable levels of intracellular RNA synthesis, structural protein production, and virion assembly. Our results showed that the IBV EIC contributed to the induction of ER stress response, as up-regulation of ER stress-related genes was markedly reduced in cells infected with the EIC-defective mutants. EIC-defective mutants also formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions into the culture supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture. Significantly, all these defective phenotypes were restored in cells infected with the putative EIC revertants. EIC mutations were also implicated in regulating IBV-induced apoptosis, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and viral pathogenicity in vivo. Taken together, this study highlights the importance of CoV EIC in modulating virion release and various aspects of CoV – host interaction.","b7b122d6d4cc409f7a22bec63936640b4cd0f334","True","Front Microbiol","Coronavirus|CoV|EIC|IBV|EIC|Two|rIBVs|EIC|rT16A|rA26F|TMD|Two|rIBVs|EIC|rT16A|A26V|rA26F/|F14N|four|EIC|RNA|IBV|EIC|EIC|EIC|IBV-|CoV EIC|CoV","cc-by","","PMC6992538","32038520","PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|LAW","PMC","2020 Jan 24","","10.3389/fmicb.2019.03022","comm_use_subset"

Its dried leaves and roots (called Isatidis Folium and Isatidis Radix, respectively) are broadly used in traditional Chinese medicine for curing diseases caused by bacteria and viruses such as influenza and viral pneumonia. Various classes of compounds isolated from this species have been identified as effective ingredients. Previous studies based on transcriptomes revealed only a few candidate genes for the biosynthesis of these active compounds in this medicinal plant. Here, we report a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of I. indigotica with a total size of 293.88 Mb and scaffold N50 = 36.16 Mb using single-molecule real-time long reads and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture techniques. We annotated 30,323 high-confidence protein-coding genes. Based on homolog searching and functional annotations, we identified many candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of main active components such as indoles, terpenoids, and phenylpropanoids. In addition, we found that some key enzyme-coding gene families related to the biosynthesis of these components were expanded due to tandem duplications, which likely drove the production of these major active compounds and explained why I. indigotica has excellent antibacterial and antiviral activities.

The basis for high mortality among pregnant hepatitis E patients remains unclear. Importantly, a large proportion of infected pregnant women present with subclinical infection as well. In order to understand the possible mechanisms influencing clinical presentation of hepatitis E in pregnant women, we explored a system biology approach. For this, PBMCs from various categories were subjected to RNAseq analysis. These included non-pregnant (NPR, acute and convalescent phases) and pregnant (PR, 2(nd) and 3(rd) trimesters, acute phase and subclinical HEV infections) patients and corresponding healthy controls. The current study deals with immune response genes. In contrast to exclusive up-regulation of nonspecific, early immune response transcripts in the NPR patients, the PR patients exhibited broader and heightened expression of genes associated with innate as well as adaptive T and B cell responses. The study identified for the first time (1) inverse relationship of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes overexpression and (2) association of differential expression of S100 series genes with disease presentation. The data suggests possible involvement of TLR4 and NOD1 in pregnant patients and alpha defensins in all patient categories suggesting a role in protection. Induction of IFNγ gene was not detected during the acute phase irrespective of pregnancy. Association of response to vitamin D, transcripts related to NK/NKT and regulatory T cells during subclinical infection are noteworthy. The data obtained here could be correlated with several studies reported earlier in hepatitis E patients suggesting utility of PBMCs as an alternate specimen. The extensive, informative data provided here for the first time should form basis for future studies that will help in understanding pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis E.","0fdba4c24e81ec738a498e2ffa501d46c22745a6","True","PLoS One","RNAseq|NPR|2(nd|3(rd|HEV|NPR|first|1|Ig|2|S100|TLR4|NK/NKT|PBMCs|first","cc-by","","PMC6996850","32012176","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL","PMC","2020 Feb 3","","10.1371/journal.pone.0228068","comm_use_subset"

This study aimed to exploratively develop a standardized preparedness system to use during unfolding threats of severe infectious diseases. METHODS: A qualitative three-step study among infectious disease prevention and control experts was performed. First, interviews (n = 5) were conducted to identify which factors trigger preparedness activities during an unfolding threat.

Phase yellow is an outbreak in the world with some likelihood of imported cases. Phase orange is a realistic chance of an unexpected case within the country, or unrest developing among population or staff; phase red is cases admitted to hospitals in the country, potentially causing a shortage of resources. Specific preparedness activities included infection prevention, diagnostics, patient care, staff, and communication. Consensus was reached on the need for the development of a preparedness system and national coordination during threats.

Previous studies have demonstrated that PBD-2 can kill various bacteria, regulate host immune responses and promote growth of piglets. However, the antiviral role of PBD-2 is rarely investigated. This study aimed to reveal the antiviral ability of PBD-2 against pseudorabies virus (PRV), the causative pathogen of Aujeszky’s disease, in PK-15 cells and in a PBD-2 expressing transgenic (TG) mouse model. METHODS: In this study, the cytotoxicity of PBD-2 on PK-15 cells was measured by CCK-8 assay. PK-15 cells were incubated with PRV pre-treated with different concentrations of PBD-2 and PRV titers in cell culture supernatants were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). TG mice and wild-type (WT) mice were intraperitoneally injected with PRV and the survival rate was recorded for 10 days. Meanwhile, tissue lesions in brain, spleen and liver of infected mice were observed and the viral loads of PRV in brain, liver and lung were analyzed by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: PBD-2 at a maximum concentration of 80 μg/mL displayed no significant cytotoxicity on PK-15 cells. A threshold concentration of PBD-2 at 40 μg/mL was required to inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells. The survival rate in PBD-2 TG mice was 50% higher than that of WT mice. In addition, TG mice showed alleviated tissue lesions in brain, spleen and liver compared with their WT littermates after PRV challenge, while viral loads of PRV in brain, liver and lung of TG mice were significantly lower than that of WT mice. CONCLUSIONS: PBD-2 could inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells and protect mice from PRV infection, which confirmed the antiviral ability of PBD-2 both in vitro and in vivo. The application of PBD-2 in developing anti-viral drugs or disease-resistant animals can be further investigated.","6f67e5b5e61f9ce94ddc8aaae34799a81c4c213d","True","Virol J","2|PRV|Aujeszky|PK-15|TG|CCK-8|PRV|PBD-2 and PRV|PCR|RT|TG|WT|PRV|10 days|PRV|RT|80 μg/mL|40 μg/mL|PRV|PK-15|50%|WT|TG|WT|PRV|PRV|TG|WT|PRV|PK-15|PRV","cc-by","","PMC6998849","32014007","CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|FAC|GPE|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|QUANTITY|QUANTITY|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|FAC|GPE|ORG|ORG|FAC|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 3","","10.1186/s12985-020-1288-4","comm_use_subset"

Diagnosis in the field or in remote locations can be challenging and alternatively samples are shipped to diagnostic labs for testing. Shipments must occur under controlled temperature conditions to prevent loss of sample integrity. We have tested the ability of magnetic Nanotrap® (NT) particles to improve stability and detection of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), viral capsid protein, and viral genomic RNA in whole human blood at elevated temperature and prolonged storage conditions. NT particles have previously been shown to capture and enrich multiple pathogens including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, coronavirus, and Rift Valley fever virus. Our study indicates that samples incubated with NT particles had detectable levels of infectious VEEV in blood equal to or greater than samples without NT treatment across all temperatures. Viral RNA detection was increased in the presence of NT particles at later time points (72 h) and higher temperature (40°C) conditions. Likewise, detection of VEEV capsid protein was enhanced in the presence of NT particles up to 72 h at 40°C. Finally, we intranasally infected C3H mice with TC-83, the live attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV, and demonstrated that NT particles could substantially increase the detection of VEEV capsid in infected blood incubated up to 72 h at 40°C. Samples without NT particles had undetectable capsid protein levels. Taken together, our data demonstrate the ability of NT particles to preserve and enable detection of VEEV in human and mouse blood samples over time and at elevated temperatures.","eddf68bf069ab23f6fbe7c7ab16c1c49335f4de9","True","Front Vet Sci","Nanotrap|Venezuelan|VEEV|RNA|Rift Valley|VEEV|RNA|72|40|VEEV|72|40|C3H|TC-83|VEEV|NT|VEEV|up to 72|40|VEEV","cc-by","","PMC6999085","32064269","ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 28","","10.3389/fvets.2019.00509","comm_use_subset"

The mechanism of organ tropism and innate immune evasion of DPV has not been completely deciphered due to a lack of cell models to study the innate immune manipulation and pathogenicity of aquatic viruses. In the present study, we isolated five types of duck primary cells [duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs), neurons, astrocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and monocytes/macrophages] to identify appropriate cell models for DPV, using tropism infection and innate immunologic assays. Cells responded differently to stimulation with DNA viruses or RNA virus analogs. DPV infection exhibited broad tropism, as the recombinant virulent strain (CHv-GFP) infected DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, but not the PBMCs, as the expression of EGFP was negligible. The basal levels of innate immunity molecules were highest in monocytes/macrophages and lower in DEFs and astrocytes. Conversely, the titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain was higher in DEFs and astrocytes than in neurons and monocytes/macrophages. The titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain were higher compared with the virulent strain in DEFs, neurons, and astrocytes. The innate immune response was not significantly induced by either DPV strain in DEFs, neurons, or astrocytes. The virulent strain persistently infected monocytes/macrophages, but the attenuated strain did so abortively, and this was accompanied by the phenomenon of innate immune inhibition and activation by the virulent and attenuated strains, respectively. Blockage of IFNAR signaling promoted replication of the attenuated strain. Pre-activation of IFNAR signaling inhibited infection by the virulent strain. The selection assay results indicated that induction of innate immunity plays an essential role in controlling DPV infection, and monocytes/macrophages are an important cell model for further investigations. Our study provided practical methods for isolating and culturing duck primary cells, and our results will facilitate further investigations of organ tropism, innate immune responses, latent infection, and the effectiveness of antiviral drugs for treating DPV and potentially other aerial bird pathogens.","5503464f5c8ac4db987ce87b05f224a7aaafc1a7","True","Front Immunol","DPV|five|PBMCs|EGFP|IFNAR|IFNAR","cc-by","","PMC6999086","32063900","ORG|CARDINAL|LAW|GPE|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 28","","10.3389/fimmu.2019.03131","comm_use_subset"

Evaluating pneumonia etiology among malnourished children may help improve empiric treatment guidelines. METHODS: During April 2015—December 2017, we conducted a case-control study among severe acute malnourished (SAM) children aged <5 years admitted to the Dhaka hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). We enrolled hospital admitted SAM children with clinical or radiological pneumonia as cases (during April 2015 to March 2017) and hospital admitted SAM children without any respiratory symptom in the past 10 days before admission as controls (during February 2016 to December 2017). We tested nasopharyngeal wash from both case and control for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza viruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), rhinovirus and adenovirus by singleplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. To identify the independent association of pneumonia with viral pathogens during February 2016 to March 2017, we used multivariable logistic regression for calculating adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: We enrolled 360 cases and 334 controls. For case and control the median age was 8 months (IQR: 5–13) and 11 months (IQR: 6–18) (p = 0.001) respectively. Weight/age Z-score was -4.3 (SD ±0.7) for cases and -4.1 (SD ±1.1) for controls (p = 0.01). Among cases 68% had both clinical and radiological pneumonia, 1% had clinical pneumonia and 31% had only radiological pneumonia. Respiratory virus detection was high in cases compared to controls [69.9% (251) vs. 44.8% (148), p = 0.0001]. The most frequently detected viruses among cases were rhinoviruses (79, 22.0%) followed by RSV (32, 8.9%), adenovirus (23, 6.4%), HPIV (22, 6.1%), influenza virus (16, 4.5%), and HMPV (16, 4.5%). Among the controls, rhinoviruses (82, 24.8%) were most commonly detected one followed by adenovirus (26,7.9%), HMPV (5, 1.5%), HPIV (4, 1.2%), RSV (3, 0.9%), and influenza virus (2, 0.6%). RSV (OR 13.1; 95% CI: 1.6, 106.1), influenza virus (OR 8.7; 95% CI: 1.0, 78.9), HPIV (3.8; 95% CI: 1.0, 14.8), and HMPV (2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.5) were independently associated with pneumonia while compared between 178 cases and 174 controls.

Transmission of H1N1 occurs from human to human through air or sometimes from pigs to humans. The influenza virus has different RNA segments, which can reassert to make new virus strain with the possibility to create an outbreak in unimmunized people. Gene reassortment is a process through which new strains are emerging in pigs, as it has specific receptors for both human influenza and avian influenza viruses. H1N1 binds specifically with an α-2,6 glycosidic bond, which is present in human respiratory tract cells as well as in pigs. Considering the fact of fast multiplication of viruses inside the living cells, rapid detection methods need an hour. Currently, WHO recommended methods for the detection of swine flu include real-time PCR in specific testing centres that take 3–4 h. More recently, a number of methods such as Antigen–Antibody or RT-LAMP and DNA biosensors have also been developed that are rapid and more sensitive. This review describes the various challenges in the diagnosis of H1N1, and merits and demerits of conventional vis-à-vis latest methods with special emphasis on biosensors.","35b1d29a27113b46ea93b8cd542cb09a9da6a0c1","True","Biosci Rep","H1N1|Orthomyxoviridae|H1N1|RNA|H1N1|α-2,6|an hour|WHO|3–4|Antigen–Antibody|RT-LAMP|H1N1","cc-by","","PMC7000365","32016385","PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|TIME|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|PERSON","PMC","2020 Feb 4","","10.1042/BSR20193852","comm_use_subset"

In addition, we determined whether EVD-related stigma is a predictor of informal health care use among EVD survivors. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 358 EVD survivors in five districts across all four geographic regions (Western Area, Northern Province, Eastern Province and Southern Province) of Sierra Leone. Ebola-related stigma was measured by adapting the validated HIV related stigma for people living with HIV/AIDS instrument. We also measured traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) use (as a measure of informal healthcare use). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. RESULTS: EVD survivors report higher levels of internalised stigma (0.92 ± 0.77) compared to total enacted stigma (0.71 ± 0.61). Social isolation (0.96 ± 0.88) was the highest reported enacted stigma subscale. Ebola survivors who identified as Christians [AOR = 2.51, 95%CI: 1.15–5.49, p = 0.021], who perceived their health to be fair/poor [AOR = 2.58, 95%CI: 1.39–4.77. p = 0.003] and who reside in the northern region of Sierra Leone [AOR = 2.80, 95%CI: 1.29–6.07, p = 0.009] were more likely to experience internalised stigma. Verbal abuse [AOR = 1.95, 95%CI: 1.09–3.49, p = 0.025] and healthcare neglect [AOR = 2.35, 95%CI: 1.37–4.02, p = 0.002] were independent predictors of T&CM use among EVD survivors. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest EVD-related stigma (internalised and enacted) is prevalent among EVD survivors since their return to their communities. Religiosity, perceived health status and region were identified as independent predictors of internalised stigma. Verbal abuse and healthcare neglect predict informal healthcare use. EVD survivor-centred and community-driven anti-stigma programs are needed to promote EVD survivors’ recovery and community re-integration.","38a33f302357e8dced322858ad61fe20b876d445","True","BMC Public Health","EVD|Sierra Leone|EVD|EVD|358|EVD|five|four|Western Area|Northern Province|Eastern Province|Southern Province|Sierra Leone|T&CM|EVD|0.92 ± 0.77|0.71 ± 0.61|0.96 ± 0.88|Christians|2.51|95%CI|1.15–5.49|0.021|2.58|0.003|Sierra|2.80|95%CI|1.29–6.07|0.009|1.95|95%CI|1.09–3.49|0.025|2.35|95%CI|1.37–4.02|0.002|T&CM|EVD|EVD|EVD|EVD|EVD survivors’","cc-by","","PMC7001224","32020858","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|LOC|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|MONEY|MONEY|MONEY|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 5","","10.1186/s12889-020-8279-7","comm_use_subset"

Iridoid glycosides are principal bioactive components from the Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis fruit that exhibit antiviral activity against several strains of IAV. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effect of Fructus Gardeniae iridoid glycoside extracts (IGEs) against IAV by cytopathogenic effect(CPE), MTT and a plaque formation assay in vitro and examined the reduction in the pulmonary index (PI), restoration of body weight, reduction in mortality and increases in survival time in vivo. As a host factor, PACT provides protection against the pathogenic influenza A virus by interacting with IAV polymerase and activating the IFN-I response. To verify the whether IGEs suppress IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner, IAV RNA replication, expression of PACT and the phosphorylation of eIF2α in A549 cells were detected; the levels of IFNβ, PACT and PKR in mouse lung tissues were determined; and the activity of IAV polymerase was evaluated in PACT-compromised cells. The results indicated that IGEs sufficiently alleviated cell damage and suppressed IAV replication in vitro, protecting mice from IAV-induced injury and lethal IAV infection. These anti-IAV effects might be related to disrupted interplay between IVA polymerase and PACT and/or prevention of a PACT-dependent overactivated IFN-I antiviral response. Taken together, our findings reveal a new facet of the mechanisms by which IGEs fight the influenza A virus in a PACT-dependent manner.","197489ce2e74e5566e1cd13fdce4a26b4eba45f6","True","Sci Rep","Gardenia|J.

Currently, there are no vaccines or therapeutic drugs clinically approved for treatments of ZIKV infection, however. And the drugs used for treating ZIKV in pregnant women require a higher safety profile. Here, we identified an anti-asthmatic drug, montelukast, which is of safety profile for pregnant women and exhibited antiviral efficacy against ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo. And we showed that montelukast could disrupt the integrity of the virions to release the viral genomic RNA, hence irreversibly inhibiting viral infectivity. In consideration of the neuro-protective activity that montelukast possessed, which was previously reported, it is promising that montelukast could be used for patients with ZIKV infection, particularly for pregnant women.","625afb5a588fd265e15b652a437ef9f521682aee","True","Front Microbiol","Zika|ZIKV|2015|ZIKV|ZIKV|ZIKV|RNA|ZIKV","cc-by","","PMC7002393","32082265","PERSON|PERSON|DATE|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON","PMC","2020 Jan 30","","10.3389/fmicb.2019.03079","comm_use_subset"

METHODS: A retrospective analysis on daily viral positive tests and daily ED visits and hospitalizations between 01/01/2003 to 31/12/2013 in Ontario, Canada. Viral data was collected from the Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases (CIRID). The Canadian Institute for Health Information reports daily ED visits and hospitalizations for RTIs, COPD and asthma as a primary diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 4,365,578 ED visits with RTIs of which 321,719 (7.4%) were admitted to hospital; 817,141 ED visits for COPD of which 260,665 (31.9%) were admitted and 649,666 ED visits with asthma of which 68,626 (10.6%) were admitted. The percentage of positive tests to influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza and adenovirus prevalence explained 57.4% of ED visits and 63.8% of hospitalizations for RTI, 41.4% of ED visits and 39.2% of hospitalizations with COPD but only 1.5% of ED visits and 2.7% of hospitalizations for asthma. The further addition of human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus over the final 3 years accounted for 66.7% of ED visits and 74.4% of hospitalizations for RTI, 52.5% of visits and 48.2% of hospitalizations for COPD, and only 13.3% of visits and 10.4% of hospitalizations for asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Community respiratory viral epidemics are major drivers of ED visits and hospitalizations with RTIs and COPD but only a modest contributor to asthma.","ce1f762e478087400412172f30e184d92f17d976","True","PLoS One","Emergency Department|ED|COPD|daily|daily|ED|31/12/2013|Ontario|Canada|the Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases|CIRID|The Canadian Institute for Health Information|daily|ED|COPD|4,365,578|ED|321,719|7.4%|817,141|ED|COPD|260,665|31.9%|649,666|ED|68,626|10.6%|RSV|57.4%|63.8%|RTI|41.4%|39.2%|COPD|only 1.5%|2.7%|the final 3 years|66.7%|ED|74.4%|RTI|52.5%|48.2%|COPD|only 13.3%|10.4%|ED|COPD","cc-by","","PMC7004370","32027687","ORG|PERSON|ORG|DATE|DATE|PERSON|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 6","","10.1371/journal.pone.0228544","comm_use_subset"

The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in response to misfolded or unfolded protein accumulation in the ER. However, the UPR successfully alleviates the ER stress. If UPR fails to restore ER homeostasis, apoptosis is induced. ER stress plays an important role in innate immune signaling in response to microorganisms. Dysregulation of UPR signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of a variety of infectious diseases. In this review, we summarize the contribution of ER stress to the innate immune response to invading microorganisms and its role in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases.","6807bdafe0aadb07814a155a43e4205e0246a2e4","True","Front Immunol","UPR|ER|UPR|UPR|UPR|ER","cc-by","","PMC7005066","32082307","ORG|LOC|ORG|ORG|ORG|LOC","PMC","2020 Jan 31","","10.3389/fimmu.2019.03147","comm_use_subset"

These cells have self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential and contribute to multiple tumor malignancies, such as recurrence, metastasis, heterogeneity, multidrug resistance, and radiation resistance. The biological activities of CSCs are regulated by several pluripotent transcription factors, such as OCT4, Sox2, Nanog, KLF4, and MYC. In addition, many intracellular signaling pathways, such as Wnt, NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB), Notch, Hedgehog, JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin), TGF (transforming growth factor)/SMAD, and PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor), as well as extracellular factors, such as vascular niches, hypoxia, tumor-associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, cancer-associated mesenchymal stem cells, extracellular matrix, and exosomes, have been shown to be very important regulators of CSCs. Molecules, vaccines, antibodies, and CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cell) cells have been developed to specifically target CSCs, and some of these factors are already undergoing clinical trials. This review summarizes the characterization and identification of CSCs, depicts major factors and pathways that regulate CSC development, and discusses potential targeted therapy for CSCs.","0c917c3becd5b37cc4e44ad2c822ba132d339728","True","Signal Transduct Target Ther","first|1994|Nanog|Wnt|NF-κB|factor-κB|Notch|Hedgehog|JAK-STAT|Janus|AKT|3-kinase/AKT|TGF|factor)/SMAD|CSC","cc-by","","PMC7005297","32047658","ORDINAL|DATE|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|GPE|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 7","","10.1038/s41392-020-0110-5","comm_use_subset"

The MERS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein mediates viral entry into target cells. For this, MERS-CoV S engages the host cell protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) and the interface between MERS-CoV S and DPP4 has been resolved on the atomic level. Here, we asked whether naturally-occurring polymorphisms in DPP4, that alter amino acid residues required for MERS-CoV S binding, influence cellular entry of MERS-CoV. By screening of public databases, we identified fourteen such polymorphisms. Introduction of the respective mutations into DPP4 revealed that all except one (Δ346-348) were compatible with robust DPP4 expression. Four polymorphisms (K267E, K267N, A291P and Δ346-348) strongly reduced binding of MERS-CoV S to DPP4 and S protein-driven host cell entry, as determined using soluble S protein and S protein bearing rhabdoviral vectors, respectively. Two polymorphisms (K267E and A291P) were analyzed in the context of authentic MERS-CoV and were found to attenuate viral replication. Collectively, we identified naturally-occurring polymorphisms in DPP4 that negatively impact cellular entry of MERS-CoV and might thus modulate MERS development in infected patients.","5b31a92b9c0bbc361c12fb2c00bcb17ff3fab61c","True","Emerg Microbes Infect","Middle East|4|DPP4|CD26|DPP4|DPP4|fourteen|one|Δ346|DPP4|Four|K267E|K267N|Δ346-348|DPP4|Two|K267E|CoV|CoV","cc-by","","PMC7006675","31964246","LOC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|PERSON","PMC","2020 Jan 21","","10.1080/22221751.2020.1713705","comm_use_subset"

Many virulence genes of pathogenic bacteria were identified in temperate phage genomes, supporting the concept that temperate phages play important roles in increasing the bacterial pathogenicity through delivery of the virulence genes. However, little is known about the roles of temperate phages in attenuation of bacterial virulence. Here, we report a novel Bordetella bronchiseptica temperate phage, vB_BbrS_PHB09 (PHB09), which has a 42,129-bp dsDNA genome with a G+C content of 62.8%. Phylogenetic analysis based on large terminase subunit indicated that phage PHB09 represented a new member of the family Siphoviridae. The genome of PHB09 contains genes encoding lysogen-associated proteins, including integrase and cI protein. The integration site of PHB09 is specifically located within a pilin gene of B. bronchiseptica. Importantly, we found that the integration of phage PHB09 significantly decreased the virulence of parental strain B. bronchiseptica Bb01 in mice, most likely through disruption the expression of pilin gene. Moreover, a single shot of the prophage bearing B. bronchiseptica strain completely protected mice against lethal challenge with wild-type virulent B. bronchiseptica, indicating the vaccine potential of lysogenized strain. Our findings not only indicate the complicated roles of temperate phages in bacterial virulence other than simple delivery of virulent genes but also provide a potential strategy for developing bacterial vaccines.","b287ba995f0d86627890bf70c5d6aad88deff2c4","True","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","Bordetella bronchiseptica|G+C|62.8%|Siphoviridae|B.|B. bronchiseptica|Bb01|B.|B.","cc-by","","PMC7010805","32117795","ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERSON|NORP|ORG|FAC|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 4","","10.3389/fcimb.2020.00014","comm_use_subset"

Their genomes comprise one or more segments of coding-sense RNA that function directly as messenger RNAs upon release into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Positive-sense RNA viruses are generally accepted to encode proteins solely on the positive strand. However, we previously identified a surprisingly long (∼1,000-codon) open reading frame (ORF) on the negative strand of some members of the family Narnaviridae which, together with RNA bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae, form a sister group to all other positive-sense RNA viruses. Here, we completed the genomes of three mosquito-associated narnaviruses, all of which have the long reverse-frame ORF. We systematically identified narnaviral sequences in public data sets from a wide range of sources, including arthropod, fungal, and plant transcriptomic data sets. Long reverse-frame ORFs are widespread in one clade of narnaviruses, where they frequently occupy >95 per cent of the genome. The reverse-frame ORFs correspond to a specific avoidance of CUA, UUA, and UCA codons (i.e. stop codon reverse complements) in the forward-frame RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF. However, absence of these codons cannot be explained by other factors such as inability to decode these codons or GC3 bias. Together with other analyses, we provide the strongest evidence yet of coding capacity on the negative strand of a positive-sense RNA virus. As these ORFs comprise some of the longest known overlapping genes, their study may be of broad relevance to understanding overlapping gene evolution and de novo origin of genes.","46c464442591d7777212f7ee389bcbfa362ddc8e","True","Virus Evol","RNA|one|RNA|RNA|∼1,000-codon|ORF|Narnaviridae|RNA|Leviviridae|RNA|three|ORF|one|95 per cent|CUA|UUA|UCA|RNA|RNA|ORF|GC3|RNA","cc-by","","PMC7010960","32064120","ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|WORK_OF_ART|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|MONEY|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 10","","10.1093/ve/veaa007","comm_use_subset"

Many studies have described how coronaviruses enter cells, but information on PEDV invasion strategies remains insufficient. Given that the differences in gene sequences and pathogenicity between classical and mutant strains of PEDV may lead to diverse invasion mechanisms, this study focused on the cellular entry pathways and cellular transport of the PEDV GI and GII subtype strains in Vero cells and IPEC-J2 cells. We first characterized the kinetics of PEDV entry into cells and found that the highest invasion rate of PEDV was approximately 33% in the IPEC-J2 cells and approximately 100% in the Vero cells. To clarify the specific endocytic pathways, systematic research methods were used and showed that PEDV enters cells via the clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis pathways, in which dynamin II, clathrin heavy chain, Eps15, cholesterol, and caveolin-1 were indispensably involved. In addition, lipid raft extraction assay showed that PEDV can also enter cells through lipid raft-mediated endocytosis. To investigate the trafficking of internalized PEDV, we found that PEDV entry into cells relied on low pH and internalized virions reached lysosomes through the early endosome–late endosome–lysosome pathway. The results concretely revealed the entry mechanisms of PEDV and provided an insightful theoretical basis for the further understanding of PEDV pathogenesis and guidance for new targets of antiviral drugs.","35346aa2228281a39b64a6185827e497e57296a3","True","Vet Res","GII|Vero|IPEC-J2|first|approximately 33%|IPEC-J2|approximately 100%|Vero|Eps15|caveolin-1|PEDV|PEDV|PEDV","cc-by","","PMC7011528","32041637","ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERSON|PERSON|NORP|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 10","","10.1186/s13567-020-0739-7","comm_use_subset"

Physical and cellular barriers of the respiratory tract mucosal surface utilize a variety of strategies to obstruct microbe entry. Physical barrier defenses including the surface fluid replete with antimicrobials, neutralizing immunoglobulins, mucus, and the epithelial cell layer with rapidly beating cilia form a near impenetrable wall that separates the external environment from the internal soft tissue of the host. Resident leukocytes, primarily of the innate immune branch, also maintain airway integrity by constant surveillance and the maintenance of homeostasis through the release of cytokines and growth factors. Unfortunately, pathogens such as influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae require hosts for their replication and dissemination, and prey on the respiratory tract as an ideal environment causing severe damage to the host during their invasion. In this review, we outline the host-pathogen interactions during influenza and post-influenza bacterial pneumonia with a focus on inter- and intra-cellular crosstalk important in pulmonary immune responses.","f481624491ae43193cf1229d54d99e8ddcef9479","True","Front Immunol","Streptococcus","cc-by","","PMC7011736","32117216","NORP","PMC","2020 Feb 4","","10.3389/fimmu.2020.00003","comm_use_subset"

The nucleocapsid (N) protein, a core component of PDCoV, is essential for virus replication and is a significant candidate in the development of diagnostics for PDCoV. In this study, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated and tested for reactivity with three truncations of the full protein (N1, N2, N3) that contained partial overlaps; of the five monoclonals chosen tested, each reacted with only the N3 truncation. The antibody designated 4E88 had highest binding affinity with the N protein and was chosen for in-depth examination. The 4E88 epitope was located to amino acids 308-AKPKQQKKPKK-318 by testing the 4E88 monoclonal for reactivity with a series of N3 truncations, then the minimal epitope, 309-KPKQQKKPK-317 (designated EP-4E88), was pinpointed by testing the 4E88 monoclonal for reactivity with a series of synthetic peptides of this region. Homology analysis showed that the EP-4E88 sequence is highly conserved among PDCoV strains, and also shares high similarity with sparrow coronavirus (HKU17), Asian leopard cat coronavirus (ALCCoV), quail coronavirus (UAE-HKU30), and sparrow deltacoronavirus (SpDCoV). Of note, the PDCoV EP-4E88 sequence shared very low similarity (<22.2%) with other porcine coronaviruses (PEDV, TGEV, PRCV, SADS-CoV, PHEV), demonstrating that it is an epitope that can be used for distinguishing PDCoV and other porcine coronavirus. 3D structural analysis revealed that amino acids of EP-4E88 were in close proximity and may be exposed on the surface of the N protein.","67f9fc7574738473d4155929c1637f1e7c36afb2","True","Int J Mol Sci","2012|PDCoV|mAbs|three|N1|N2|N3|five|N3|308-AKPKQQKKPKK-318|N3|Asian|ALCCoV|UAE-HKU30|SpDCoV|PDCoV|22.2%|PEDV|TGEV|PRCV|SADS-CoV|PHEV|PDCoV","cc-by","","PMC7013544","31963776","DATE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|NORP|PERSON|ORG|NORP|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|PERSON|GPE","PMC","2020 Jan 19","","10.3390/ijms21020648","comm_use_subset"

Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the top four affected phyla. The proportion of Proteobacteria was higher in infected than in healthy piglets, and the opposite was observed for Bacteroidetes (more than four-fold higher in the healthy group). In the infected group, Fusobacterium accounted for 36.56% and 21.61% in the colonic mucosa and contents, respectively, while in the healthy group, they comprised 22.53% and 12.67%, respectively.

Its disease burden varies by age and etiology and is time dependent. We aimed to investigate the annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 30,994 children (aged 0–18 years) with CAP between 2010 and 2015 at 23 nationwide hospitals in South Korea. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia was clinically classified as macrolide-sensitive MP, macrolide-less effective MP (MLEP), and macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP) based on fever duration after initiation of macrolide treatment, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests. RESULTS: MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the two most commonly identified pathogens of CAP. With the two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015), the rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends of 36.4% of the total MP pneumonia. In children < 2 years of age, RSV (34.0%) was the most common cause of CAP, followed by MP (9.4%); however, MP was the most common cause of CAP in children aged 2–18 years of age (45.3%). Systemic corticosteroid was most commonly administered for MP pneumonia. The rate of hospitalization in intensive care units was the highest for RSV pneumonia, and ventilator care was most commonly needed in cases of adenovirus pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides fundamental data to establish public health policies to decrease the disease burden due to CAP and improve pediatric health.","5da7956e10ac1b78cc0fda6f4043ea034227459e","True","BMC Infect Dis","CAP|one|annual|CAP|30,994|0–18 years|CAP|between 2010 and 2015|23|South Korea|Mycoplasma|MRMP|RSV|two|CAP|two|2011|2015|MRMP|36.4%|< 2 years of age|RSV|34.0%|CAP|9.4%|CAP|2–18 years|45.3%|RSV|CAP","cc-by","","PMC7017508","32050912","ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 12","","10.1186/s12879-020-4810-9","comm_use_subset"

ADPr-binding by the alphavirus nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) MD is necessary for the initiation of virus replication in neural cells, whereas hydrolase activity facilitates replication complex amplification. To determine the importance of these activities for pathogenesis of alphavirus encephalomyelitis, mutations were introduced into the nsP3 MD of Sindbis virus (SINV), and the effects on ADPr binding and hydrolase activities, virus replication, immune responses, and disease were assessed. Elimination of ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities (G32E) severely impaired in vitro replication of SINV in neural cells and in vivo replication in the central nervous systems of 2-week-old mice with reversion to wild type (WT) (G) or selection of a less compromising change (S) during replication. SINVs with decreased binding and hydrolase activities (G32S and G32A) or with hydrolase deficiency combined with better ADPr-binding (Y114A) were less virulent than WT virus. Compared to the WT, the G32S virus replicated less well in both the brain and spinal cord, induced similar innate responses, and caused less severe disease with full recovery of survivors, whereas the Y114A virus replicated well, induced higher expression of interferon-stimulated and NF-κB-induced genes, and was cleared more slowly from the spinal cord with persistent paralysis in survivors. Therefore, MD function was important for neural cell replication both in vitro and in vivo and determined the outcome from alphavirus encephalomyelitis in mice.","54a6d0d7afc568a29f625c33187e6800b0f72087","True","mBio","Macrodomain|MD|RNA|ADP|ADP|3|MD|MD|Sindbis|SINV|SINV|2-week-old|G32S|G32A|Y114A|WT|G32S|Y114A|MD","cc-by","","PMC7018654","32047134","GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|NORP|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE","PMC","2020 Feb 11","","10.1128/mBio.03253-19","comm_use_subset"

We performed a 15-year follow-up on the lung and bone conditions of SARS patients. We evaluated the recovery from lung damage and femoral head necrosis in an observational cohort study of SARS patients using pulmonary CT scans, hip joint MRI examinations, pulmonary function tests and hip joint function questionnaires. Eighty medical staff contracted SARS in 2003. Two patients died of SARS, and 78 were enrolled in this study from August 2003 to March 2018. Seventy-one patients completed the 15-year follow-up.

LASV is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a deadly hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa, whereas MOPV is non-pathogenic in humans. The Z matrix protein of arenaviruses is essential to virus assembly and budding by recruiting host factors, a mechanism that remains partially defined. To better characterize the interactions involved, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the Z proteins from LASV and MOPV as a bait. The cellular proteins ITCH and WWP1, two members of the Nedd4 family of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, were found to bind the Z proteins of LASV, MOPV and other arenaviruses. The PPxY late-domain motif of the Z proteins is required for the interaction with ITCH, although the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of ITCH is not involved in Z ubiquitination. The silencing of ITCH was shown to affect the replication of the old-world mammarenaviruses LASV, MOPV, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and to a lesser extent Lujo virus (LUJV). More precisely, ITCH was involved in the egress of virus-like particles and the release of infectious progeny viruses.

Antibodies directed against the NiV-glycoprotein (G) protein are known to play a major role in clearing NiV infection and in providing vaccine-induced protective immunity. More recently, T cells have been also shown to be involved in recovery from NiV infection. So far, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of NiV-G that are recognized by CD8 T cells. In this study, NiV-G protein served as the target immunogen to activate NiV-specific cellular immune responses. Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for the generation of MVA–NiV-G candidate vaccines expressing different versions of recombinant NiV-G. Overlapping peptides covering the entire NiV-G protein were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR−/−) mice after vaccination with the MVA–NiV-G candidate vaccines. We have identified an H2-b-restricted nonamer peptide epitope with CD8 T cell antigenicity and a H2-b 15mer with CD4 T cell antigenicity in the NiV-G protein. The identification of this epitope and the availability of the MVA–NiV-G candidate vaccines will help to evaluate NiV-G-specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of NiV-G infection. Of note, a soluble version of NiV-G was advantageous in activating NiV-G-specific cellular immune responses using these peptides.","8607aac9046864becdec9a89df48524d61192e09","True","Viruses","NiV|NiV|NiV|NiV|NiV-G|CD8|NiV-G|NiV|Modified Vaccinia|Ankara|NiV|NiV|NiV|MVA|NiV|15mer|NiV|MVA|NiV|NiV|NiV|NiV-G|NiV-G-specific","cc-by","","PMC7019319","31878180","ORG|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|DATE|GPE|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERSON","PMC","2019 Dec 24","","10.3390/v12010026","comm_use_subset"

Initial interaction between DCs and viruses facilitates cell activation and migration to secondary lymphoid tissues, where these antigen presenting cells (APCs) prime specific adaptive immune responses. Some viruses, however, have evolved strategies to subvert the migratory capacity of DCs as a way to disseminate infection systemically. Here we focus on the role of Siglec-1, a sialic acid-binding type I lectin receptor potently upregulated by type I interferons on DCs, that acts as a double edge sword, containing viral replication through the induction of antiviral immunity, but also favoring viral spread within tissues. Such is the case for distant enveloped viruses like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or Ebola virus (EBOV), which incorporate sialic acid-containing gangliosides on their viral membrane and are effectively recognized by Siglec-1. Here we review how Siglec-1 is highly induced on the surface of human DCs upon viral infection, the way this impacts different antigen presentation pathways, and how enveloped viruses have evolved to exploit these APC functions as a potent dissemination strategy in different anatomical compartments.","bc763a4c1cb0175d61d1332af8d137d0482df73b","True","Viruses","Siglec-1|Siglec-1|Siglec-1|APC","cc-by","","PMC7019426","31861617","ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 19","","10.3390/v12010008","comm_use_subset"

The gold standard molecular method for lab-based diagnosis of ZIKV, from either patient samples or insect vectors, is reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The method, however, is costly and requires lab-based equipment and expertise, which severely limits its use as a point-of-care (POC) tool in resource-poor settings. Moreover, given the lack of antivirals or approved vaccines for ZIKV infection, a POC diagnostic test is urgently needed for the early detection of new outbreaks and to adequately manage patients. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a compelling alternative to RT-qPCR for ZIKV and other arboviruses. This low-cost molecular system can be freeze-dried for distribution and exhibits high specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency. A growing body of evidence suggests that LAMP assays can provide greater accessibility to much-needed diagnostics for ZIKV infections, especially in developing countries where the ZIKV is now endemic. This review summarizes the different LAMP methods that have been developed for the virus and summarizes their features, advantages, and limitations.","7151947d17c83f7764b115d4e21a982738bb12f6","True","Viruses","Zika|ZIKV|Americas|ZIKV|RT|POC|ZIKV|POC|RT|ZIKV|LAMP|ZIKV|ZIKV","cc-by","","PMC7019470","31877989","PERSON|PERSON|LOC|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON","PMC","2019 Dec 23","","10.3390/v12010019","comm_use_subset"

The symptoms that were significant positive predictors for confirmed influenza were fever, cough, myalgia, headache, malaise, and sudden onset. Fever had the highest aDOR in all weeks (4.03; 95% CI 3.38–4.80) and epidemic weeks (2.78; 95% CI 2.21–3.50). All of the case definitions assessed performed better in patients with comorbidities than in those without. The performance of symptoms varied by age groups, with fever being of high value in older people, and cough being of high value in children. In patients with comorbidities, the performance of fever was the highest (aDOR 5.45; 95% CI 3.43–8.66). No differences in the performance of the case definition or symptoms in influenza cases according to virus type were found.","ed22ff950ded9997b793e0cc610c7228fb57e7bb","True","Viruses","eleven years|Catalonia|95%|all weeks|weeks|the World Health Organization|ILI|all weeks|2.69|95%|weeks|2.20|95%|CI|all weeks|4.03|95%|and epidemic weeks|2.78|95%|5.45|95%","cc-by","","PMC7019582","31947696","DATE|GPE|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT","PMC","2020 Jan 14","","10.3390/v12010095","comm_use_subset"

The type I interferon (type I IFN)-mediated immune responses provide host protection from infectious diseases. Several coronaviruses have been reported to evolve diverse strategies to evade host IFN response. However, whether feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) antagonizes the type I IFN signaling remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that FIPV strain DF2 infection not only failed to induce interferon-β (IFN-β) and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) production, but also inhibited Sendai virus (SEV) or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C))-induced IFN-β production. Subsequently, we found that one of the non-structural proteins encoded by the FIPV genome, nsp5, interrupted type I IFN signaling in a protease-dependent manner by cleaving the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) essential modulator (NEMO) at three sites—glutamine132 (Q132), Q205, and Q231. Further investigation revealed that the cleavage products of NEMO lost the ability to activate the IFN-β promoter. Mechanistically, the nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage disrupted the recruitment of the TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK) to NEMO, which reduced the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to the inhibition of type I IFN production. Our research provides new insights into the mechanism for FIPV to counteract host innate immune response.","8c9c650f233ed3a031c995a887d8dfbc8b41e78c","True","Viruses","Feline|FIP|feline|ISG|Sendai|SEV|C))-induced IFN-β|κB|NEMO|three|Q205|Q231|NEMO|nsp5-mediated NEMO|TRAF|NF-κB|TANK|NEMO|3","cc-by","","PMC7019732","31905881","DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|NORP|QUANTITY|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|NORP|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL","PMC","2019 Dec 30","","10.3390/v12010043","comm_use_subset"

Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is an important component of this response, and we show that SINV-infected differentiated neurons respond to IFN-γ in vitro by induction of antiviral genes and suppression of virus replication. To determine the in vivo effects of IFN-γ on SINV clearance and T cell responses, C57BL/6 mice lacking IFN-γ or IFN-γ receptor-1 were compared to wild-type (WT) mice after intracranial SINV infection. In WT mice, IFN-γ was first produced in the CNS by natural killer cells and then by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Mice with impaired IFN-γ signaling initiated clearance of viral RNA earlier than WT mice associated with CNS entry of more granzyme B-producing CD8(+) T cells. However, these mice established fewer CD8(+) tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells and were more likely to experience reactivation of viral RNA synthesis late after infection. Therefore, IFN-γ suppresses the local development of granzyme B-expressing CD8(+) T cells and slows viral RNA clearance but promotes CD8(+) T(RM) cell establishment.","f51b986600acc015fa48820a1ec11c90ea871d6d","True","Viruses","Sindbis|SINV|CNS|IFN-γ|SINV|IFN-γ|IFN-γ|SINV|IFN-γ|IFN-γ receptor-1|SINV|WT|IFN-γ|first|CNS|CD4(+|IFN-γ|RNA|CNS|CD8(+|T(RM|RNA|IFN-γ|RNA","cc-by","","PMC7019780","31963302","NORP|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 16","","10.3390/v12010113","comm_use_subset"

The two-day gathering featured 30 talks and 13 posters—all of which focused on specific areas of current virology and prion protein research. The keynote presentation reviewed new tools for microbial discovery and diagnostics. This timely discussion described the opportunities new investigators have to expand the field of microbiology into chronic and acute diseases, the pitfalls of sensitive molecular methods for pathogen discovery, and ways in which microbiology help us understand disruptions in the social fabric that pose pandemic threats at least as real as Ebola or influenza. Other areas of interest included host factors that influence virus replication, in-depth analysis of virus transcription and its effect on host gene expression, and multiple discussions of virus pathology, epidemiology as well as new avenues of diagnosis and treatment. The meeting was held at the peak of fall Aspen colors, surrounded by five mountains >11,000 ft (3.3 km), where the secluded campus provided the ideal setting for extended discussions, outdoor exercise and stargazing.

The continuous spread and great pandemic potential of MERS-CoV make it necessarily important to develop effective vaccines. We previously demonstrated that the application of Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles as a bacterial vector displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS vaccine candidate that is capable of producing potential neutralization antibodies. We have also used the rabies virus (RV) as a viral vector to design a recombinant vaccine by expressing the MERS-CoV S1 (spike) protein on the surface of the RV. In this study, we compared the immunological efficacy of the vaccine candidates in BALB/c mice in terms of the levels of humoral and cellular immune responses. The results show that the rabies virus vector-based vaccine can induce remarkably earlier antibody response and higher levels of cellular immunity than the GEM particles vector. However, the GEM particles vector-based vaccine candidate can induce remarkably higher antibody response, even at a very low dose of 1 µg. These results indicate that vaccines constructed using different vaccine vector platforms for the same pathogen have different rates and trends in humoral and cellular immune responses in the same animal model. This discovery not only provides more alternative vaccine development platforms for MERS-CoV vaccine development, but also provides a theoretical basis for our future selection of vaccine vector platforms for other specific pathogens.","e63f49d69364214383bb4bd983e941816b11b8da","True","Viruses","Middle East|Gram|CoV|RBD|RV|the MERS-CoV S1|RV|BALB/|GEM|GEM|1|CoV","cc-by","","PMC7019946","31968702","LOC|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON","PMC","2020 Jan 20","","10.3390/v12010125","comm_use_subset"

However, in vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract, causing a more severe disease (e.g., pneumonia). Respiratory viruses can also exacerbate asthma and lead to various types of respiratory distress syndromes. Furthermore, as they can adapt fast and cross the species barrier, some of these pathogens, like influenza A and SARS-CoV, have occasionally caused epidemics or pandemics, and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality. For a few decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that several respiratory viruses have neuroinvasive capacities, since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Viruses infecting human CNS cells could then cause different types of encephalopathy, including encephalitis, and long-term neurological diseases. Like other well-recognized neuroinvasive human viruses, respiratory viruses may damage the CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals (virus-induced neuro-immunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly causes damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology). The etiological agent of several neurological disorders remains unidentified. Opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of these disorders whose etiology remains poorly understood. Herein, we present a global portrait of some of the most prevalent or emerging human respiratory viruses that have been associated with possible pathogenic processes in CNS infection, with a special emphasis on human coronaviruses.","b788a8861367f5eefe81794e3c77c4a15a872b03","True","Viruses","a few decades|CNS|Herein","cc-by","","PMC7020001","31861926","DATE|ORG|PERSON","PMC","2019 Dec 20","","10.3390/v12010014","comm_use_subset"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of respiratory viruses in the lower airways of individuals undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, with and without acute lower respiratory infection (respectively WRI and WORI groups). METHODS: We studied 44 mini-bronchoalveolar lavage samples (collected with a double catheter, Combicath® kit) from patients with mean age in the seventh decade, 20 from WORI group and 24 from WRI group, who were hospitalized for acute respiratory failure in Intensive Care Units of two hospitals in the Lisbon area. Real-time PCR was applied to verify analyse the presence of 15 common respiratory viruses (adenovirus, human bocavirus, influenza virus A and B, repiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4, human enterovirus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus group 1 (229E, NL63) and 2 (OC43, HKU1). RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in six of the 20 patients in the WORI group: influenza AH3 (n = 2), parainfluenza virus 1/3 (n = 2), human rhinovirus (n = 2), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 1) and human metapneumovirus (n = 1).

Unraveling the involvement of miRNA as a key cellular factor during in vitro canine parvovirus (CPV) infection may facilitate the discovery of potential intervention candidates. However, the examination of miRNA expression profiles in CPV in tissue culture systems has not been fully elucidated. METHOD: In the present study, we utilized high-throughput small RNA-seq (sRNA-seq) technology to investigate the altered miRNA profiling in miRNA libraries from uninfected (Control) and CPV-2c infected Crandell Reese Feline Kidney cells. RESULTS: We identified five of known miRNAs (miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-1247-3p, miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p) and three novel miRNAs (Novel 137, Novel 141 and Novel 102) by sRNA-seq with differentially expressed genes in the miRNA repertoire of CPV-infected cells over control. We further predicted the potential target genes of the aforementioned miRNAs using sequence homology algorithms. Notably, the targets of miR-1247-3p exhibited a potential function associated with cellular defense and humoral response to CPV. To extend the probing scheme for gene targets of miR-1247-3p, we explored and performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of its target genes. We discovered 229 putative targets from a total of 38 enriched GO terms. The top over-represented GO enrichment in biological process were lymphocyte activation and differentiation, marginal zone B cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, negative regulation of programed cell death, and negative regulation of signaling. We next constructed a GO biological process network composed of 28 target genes of miR-1247-3p, of which, some genes, namely BCL6, DLL1, GATA3, IL6, LEF1, LFNG and WNT1 were among the genes with obviously intersected in multiple GO terms. CONCLUSION: The miRNA-1247-3p and its cognate target genes suggested their great potential as novel therapeutic targets or diagnostic biomarkers of CPV or other related viruses.","f287cdbc6b706443ee5c1a1e50050515d8a613c7","True","PeerJ","miRNA|CPV|miRNA|CPV|METHOD|RNA-seq|miRNA|miRNA|Control|CPV-2c|Crandell|Feline Kidney|five|three|CPV-|CPV|Gene Ontology|229|38|GO|28|GATA3|LFNG|CPV","cc-by","","PMC7023829","32095352","CARDINAL|ORG|FAC|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 12","","10.7717/peerj.8522","comm_use_subset"

"Takayama-Ito, Mutsuyo; Saijo, Masayuki","Antiviral Drugs Against Severe Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus Infection","Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), which is a novel bunyavirus. SFTSV was first isolated from patients who presented with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction in China. Subsequently, it was found to be widely distributed in Southeast Asia (Korea, Japan, and Vietnam). SFTSV can be transmitted not only from ticks but also from domestic animals, companion animals, and humans. Because the case fatality rate of SFTS is high (6–30%), development of specific and effective treatment for SFTS is required. Studies of potential antiviral drugs for SFTS-specific therapy have been conducted on existing or newly discovered agents in vitro and in vivo, with ribavirin and favipiravir being the most promising candidates. While animal experiments and retrospective studies have demonstrated the limited efficacy of ribavirin, it was also speculated that ribavirin would be effective in patients with a viral load <1 × 10(6) copies/mL. Favipiravir showed higher efficacy than ribavirin against SFTSV in in vitro assays and greater efficacy in animal models, even administrated 3 days after the virus inoculation. Although clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in SFTS patients in Japan are underway, this has yet to be confirmed. Other drugs, including hexachlorophene, calcium channel blockers, 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine, caffeic acid, amodiaquine, and interferons, have also been evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy against SFTSV. Among them, calcium channel blockers are promising because in addition to their efficacy in vitro and in vivo, retrospective clinical data have indicated that nifedipine, one of the calcium channel blockers, reduced the case fatality rate by >5-fold. Although further research is necessary to develop SFTS-specific therapy, considerable progress has been achieved in this area.

Here, we report a crystal structure of EV71 3D(pol) elongation complex (EC) at 1.8 Å resolution. The structure reveals that the 5′-end guanosine of the downstream RNA template interacts with a fingers domain pocket, with the base sandwiched by H44 and R277 side chains through hydrophobic stacking interactions, and these interactions are still maintained after one in-crystal translocation event induced by nucleotide incorporation, implying that the pocket could regulate the functional properties of the polymerase by interacting with RNA. When mutated, residue R277 showed an impact on virus proliferation in virological studies with residue H44 having a synergistic effect. In vitro biochemical data further suggest that mutations at these two sites affect RNA binding, EC stability, but not polymerase catalytic rate (k(cat)) and apparent NTP affinity (K(M,NTP)). We propose that, although rarely captured by crystallography, similar surface pocket interaction with nucleobase may commonly exist in nucleic acid motor enzymes to facilitate their processivity.

The results showed that all five isolates exhibited high adhesive potential, remarkable aggregation capacity, and antibacterial activities. Upon assessment of the safety, these strains were negative for hemolytic activity and all tested virulence genes. In vivo safety assessment showed no adverse effects of isolated strains supplementation on the body weight gain and organ indices of the treated mice.

This analysis is part of the World Health Organization Global Observatory on Health Research and Development’s work with the overall aim to enable evidence-informed deliberations and decisions on new investments in health research and development. The analysis expands on the interactive data visualisations of these data on the Observatory’s website and describes the methods used to enable the categorisation of grants by health categories using automated data-mining techniques. METHODS: Grants data were extracted from the World RePORT platform for 2016, the most recent year with data from all funders. A data-mining algorithm was developed in Java to categorise grants by health category. The analysis explored the distribution of grants by funder, recipient country and organisation, type of grant, health category, average grant duration, and the nature of collaborations between recipients of direct grants and the institutions they collaborated with. RESULTS: Out of a total of 69,420 grants in 2016, the United States of America’s National Institutes of Health funded the greatest number of grants (52,928; 76%) and had the longest average grant duration (6 years and 10 months). Grants for research constituted 70.4% (48,879) of all types of grants, followed by grants for training (13,008; 18.7%) and meetings (2907; 4.2%). Of grant recipients by income group, low-income countries received only 0.2% (165) of all grants. Almost three-quarters of all grants were for non-communicable diseases (72%; 40,035), followed by communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (20%; 11,123), and injuries (6%; 3056).

Mass spectrometry‐based techniques are also routinely used to assess glycosylation and other post‐translational modifications, disulfide bond linkage, and scrambling as well as for the detection of host cell protein contaminants in the field of biopharmaceuticals. The role of mass spectrometry in vaccine development has been very limited but is now expanding as the landscape of global vaccine development is shifting towards the development of recombinant vaccines. In this review, the role of mass spectrometry in vaccine development is presented, some of the ongoing efforts to develop vaccines for diseases with global unmet medical need are discussed and the regulatory challenges of implementing mass spectrometry techniques in a quality control laboratory setting are highlighted.","b4e276ce333eefee623e9d425f5c538c64b567cc","True","Mass Spectrom Rev","the last decade|post‐translational","cc-by","","PMC7027533","29852530","DATE|NORP","PMC","2020 May 31 Mar-Apr","","10.1002/mas.21571","comm_use_subset"

This cell line designated EL has been maintained in Leibovitz L‐15 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum over 72 months, and subcultured more than 90 times. The EL cell line consisted predominantly of fibroblast‐like cells, which could survive over 100 days in vitro, and could grow at 15–32°C. The optimum temperature for growth was 27°C. The chromosome analysis revealed a modal diploid karyotype of 2n = 38. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by the 18S recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The susceptibility test indicated significant cytopathic effects in the EL cells with regard to the Rana grylio virus and the Herpesvirus anguillae. The viral replication was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction analysis. Following poly (I:C) exposure, the expression levels of the immune‐related molecules interferon regulatory factor‐7 (irf7) and transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) were downregulated in EL cells, whereas the expression levels of the rf3 and the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were upregulated. All four genes were significantly upregulated following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These data suggested the application of EL cell line for viral identification, as well as for immunodiagnosis and pharmacological targeting.","fb8e2e76092de55f4b7f22bd0106f6c3853ca3bd","True","Cell Biol Int","European|Anguilla|EL|Leibovitz L‐15|10%|72 months|more than 90|EL|fibroblast‐like|100 days|15–32|27|2n|38|r)RNA|EL|Rana|Herpesvirus|EL|rf3|P450|four|LPS|EL","cc-by","","PMC7028054","31814207","NORP|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Mar 19","","10.1002/cbin.11276","comm_use_subset"

However, the relationships between hosts and viruses are various and virus infections do not necessarily cause diseases in their hosts. Rather, recent studies have shown that viral infections sometimes have beneficial effects on the biological functions and/or evolution of hosts.

N.","Secular trends in incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong: A retrospective cohort study","BACKGROUND: There is very limited data on the time trend of diabetes incidence in Asia. Using population-level data, we report the secular trend of the incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2015. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Hong Kong Diabetes Surveillance Database hosts clinical information on people with diabetes receiving care under the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, a statutory body that governs all public hospitals and clinics. Sex-specific incidence rates were standardised to the age structure of the World Health Organization population. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to describe incidence trends. A total of 562,022 cases of incident diabetes (type 1 diabetes [n = 2,426]: mean age at diagnosis is 32.5 years, 48.4% men; type 2 diabetes [n = 559,596]: mean age at diagnosis is 61.8 years, 51.9% men) were included. Among people aged <20 years, incidence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes increased. For type 1 diabetes, the incidence increased from 3.5 (95% CI 2.2–4.9) to 5.3 (95% CI 3.4–7.1) per 100,000 person-years (average annual percentage change [AAPC] 3.6% [95% CI 0.2–7.1], p < 0.05) in boys and from 4.3 (95% CI 2.7–5.8) to 6.4 (95% CI 4.3–8.4) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 4.7% [95% CI 1.7–7.7], p < 0.05] in girls; for type 2 diabetes, the incidence increased from 4.6 (95% CI 3.2–6.0) to 7.5 (95% CI 5.5–9.6) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 5.9% [95% CI 3.4–8.5], p < 0.05) in boys and from 5.9 (95% CI 4.3–7.6) to 8.5 (95% CI 6.2–10.8) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 4.8% [95% CI 2.7–7.0], p < 0.05) in girls. In people aged 20 to <40 years, incidence of type 1 diabetes remained stable, but incidence of type 2 diabetes increased over time from 75.4 (95% CI 70.1–80.7) to 110.8 (95% CI 104.1–117.5) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 4.2% [95% CI 3.1–5.3], p < 0.05) in men and from 45.0 (95% CI 41.4–48.6) to 62.1 (95% CI 57.8–66.3) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 3.3% [95% CI 2.3–4.2], p < 0.05) in women. In people aged 40 to <60 years, incidence of type 2 diabetes increased until 2011/2012 and then flattened. In people aged ≥60 years, incidence was stable in men and declined in women after 2011. No trend was identified in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in people aged ≥20 years. The present study is limited by its reliance on electronic medical records for identification of people with diabetes, which may result in incomplete capture of diabetes cases. The differentiation of type 1 and type 2 diabetes was based on an algorithm subject to potential misclassification. CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in incidence of type 2 diabetes in people aged <40 years and stabilisation in people aged ≥40 years. Incidence of type 1 diabetes continued to climb in people aged <20 years but remained constant in other age groups.","acdc7132a3cc967450623c8ddcb38ec4214f6850","True","PLoS Med","Asia|1|2|Hong Kong|between 2002 and 2015|The Hong Kong Diabetes Surveillance Database|the Hong Kong Hospital Authority|the World Health Organization|Joinpoint|562,022|1|2,426|32.5 years|48.4%|2|559,596|61.8 years|51.9%|20 years|1|2|1|3.5|95%|CI|5.3|95%|3.4–7.1|100,000|annual|AAPC|3.6%|95%|0.05|4.3|95%|CI|6.4|95%|4.3–8.4|100,000|AAPC 4.7%|95%|0.05|2|4.6|95%|7.5|95%|100,000|AAPC 5.9%|95%|0.05|5.9|95%|8.5|95%|CI|100,000|AAPC 4.8%|95%|2.7–7.0|0.05|20 to <40 years|1|2|75.4|95%|110.8 (|95%|CI|100,000|AAPC|4.2%|95%|3.1–5.3|0.05|45.0|95%|CI|41.4–48.6|62.1|95%|CI 57.8–66.3|100,000|AAPC 3.3%|95%|CI|0.05|40 to <60 years|2|2011/2012|2011|1|1|2|2|<40 years|≥40 years|1|20 years","cc-by","","PMC7032690","32078650","LOC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|PERSON|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|WORK_OF_ART|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE","PMC","2020 Feb 20","","10.1371/journal.pmed.1003052","comm_use_subset"
"Hartenian, Ella; Gilbertson, Sarah; Federspiel, Joel D.; Cristea, Ileana M.; Glaunsinger, Britt A.","RNA decay during gammaherpesvirus infection reduces RNA polymerase II occupancy of host promoters but spares viral promoters","In mammalian cells, widespread acceleration of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation is linked to impaired RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68-induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. This reduced Pol II occupancy is accompanied by down-regulation of multiple Pol II subunits and TFIIB in the nucleus of infected cells, as revealed by mass spectrometry-based global measurements of protein abundance. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We propose a model in which the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA within replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced transcript loss.","fbaf6a3ac63158b74ca6b50f01c98d56936a844d","True","PLoS Pathog","RNA|II|Pol II|Kaposi|KSHV|68|MHV68|RNA|Pol II|Pol II|Pol II|TFIIB|Pol II","cc-by","","PMC7032723","32032393","ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON","PMC","2020 Feb 7","","10.1371/journal.ppat.1008269","comm_use_subset"

"Yoo, Hongseok; Oh, Jimi; Park, Chul","Characteristics of fever and response to antipyretic therapy in military personnel with adenovirus-positive community-acquired pneumonia","BACKGROUND: In 2014, an outbreak of adenoviral pneumonia occurred in the Korean military training center. However, there are limited data on the characteristics of the fever and its response to antipyretic therapy in immunocompetent adults with adenovirus-positive community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: The medical records of the patients who were admitted to the Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital for the treatment of CAP between January 2014 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into three groups, namely, the adenovirus-positive (Adv) group, the adenovirus-negative (Non-Adv) group and the unknown pathogen group, according to the results of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and sputum culture used to measure adenovirus and other bacteria or viruses in respiratory specimens. We evaluated and compared the demographics, clinicolaboratory findings and radiological findings upon admission between the two groups. RESULTS: Out of the 251 military personnel with CAP during the study periods, 67 were classified into the Adv group, while 134 were classified into the Non-Adv group and 50 were classified into the unknown pathogen group. The patients in the Adv group had a longer duration of fever after admission (3.2 ± 1.6 vs. 1.9 ± 1.2 vs. 2.2 ± 1.5 days, P = 0.018) and symptom onset (5.8 ± 2.2 vs. 3.9 ± 2.5 vs. 3.7 ± 2.0 days, P = 0.006) than patients in the Non-Adv and unknown pathogen groups, respectively. The patients in the Adv group had a higher mean temperature at admission (37.8 ± 0.3 vs. 37.3 ± 0.3 vs. 37.3 ± 0.3, P = 0.005), and more patients were observed over 40 and 39 to 40(14.9% vs. 2.2% vs. 4.0%, 35.8% vs. 3.7% vs. 6.0%, P < 0.001) than those in the Non-Adv and unknown pathogen groups, respectively. The Adv group more commonly had no response or exhibited adverse events after antipyretic treatment compared to the Non-Adv group (17.9% vs. 1.5%, 35.0% vs. 4.3%, P < 0.001, P = 0.05, respectively). In addition, the time from admission to overall clinical stabilization was significantly longer in the patients in the Adv group than in those in the Non-Adv group (4.3 ± 2.8 vs. 2.9 ± 1.8 days, P = 0.034, respectively). Furthermore, no significant difference in the length of hospital stay was observed between the two groups, and no patient died in either group. CONCLUSION: In this study, Adv-positive CAP in immunocompetent military personnel patients had distinct fever characteristics and responses to antipyretic treatment.","b50c31a428792413355bec3fe2f5eaa30e73fefe","True","Mil Med Res","2014|Korean|CAP|the Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital|CAP|between January 2014|December 2016|three|Non-Adv|two|251|CAP|67|Adv|134|Non-Adv|50|Adv|3.2 ± 1.6|1.9 ±|2.2 ±|1.5 days|0.018|5.8|±|3.9|±|2.0 days|0.006|Non-Adv|Adv|37.8 ± 0.3|37.3|±|37.3|±|0.005|over 40|39 to|40(14.9%|2.2%|4.0%|35.8%|3.7%|6.0%|0.001|the Non-Adv|Adv|Non-Adv|17.9%|1.5%|35.0%|4.3%|0.001|0.05|Adv|Non-Adv|4.3 ± 2.8|2.9|±|1.8 days|0.034|two|CAP","cc-by","","PMC7033854","32079545","DATE|NORP|PERSON|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|WORK_OF_ART|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|MONEY|CARDINAL|MONEY|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|WORK_OF_ART|ORG|MONEY|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|FAC|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 21","","10.1186/s40779-020-00235-x","comm_use_subset"

Methods: The clinical and immunological data of four patients diagnosed with combined immunodeficiency (CID) from two related Saudi families were collected. Autozygosity mapping of all available members and whole exome sequencing of the index case were performed to define the genetic etiology. Results: The patients had early onset (2–4 months of age) severe infections caused by viruses, bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. They all had hypogammaglobulinemia and low absolute lymphocyte count. Their lymphocytes failed to respond to PHA mitogen stimulation. A novel homozygous non-sense mutation in the IKBKB gene, c.850C>T (p.

Structural studies on virus-antibody immune complexes are important for better understanding the molecular mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization and also provide valuable information for structure-based vaccine design. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has recently matured as a powerful structural technique for studying bio-macromolecular complexes. When combined with X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM provides a routine approach for structurally characterizing the immune complexes formed between icosahedral viruses and their antibodies. In this review, recent advances in the structural understanding of virus-antibody interactions are outlined for whole virions with icosahedral T = pseudo 3 (picornaviruses) and T = 3 (flaviviruses) architectures, focusing on the dynamic nature of viral shells in different functional states. Glycoprotein complexes from pleomorphic enveloped viruses are also discussed as immune complex antigens.

We report a 20-month-old female admitted for suspected CAP. History included a week-long cough, fever, dyspnea, single occurrence of seizure-like activity, and a sick contact. Initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed left lower lobe pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion with a complex left pleural effusion. Ultrasound findings prompted the need for contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest confirmed a large pleural effusion with major atelectasis and mediastinal shift. The patient was treated with empiric antibiotics, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) decortication of empyema, and chest tube placement. Due to intraoperative complications, the VATS decortication was aborted and patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). A thoracentesis with culture failed to isolate a bacterial organism. Dexamethasone was started after repeat CXR showed persistent infiltrate. Subsequent contrast-enhanced CT of the chest showed a large collection of air and persistent consolidation. The patient received repeat VATS decortication and reinsertion of a chest tube. Repeat pleural fluid cultures failed to isolate a bacterial organism. Infectious disease (ID) consult recommended linezolid 140 mg Q8H for 4 weeks. Seven days after second VATS, a respiratory pathogen panel was positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus. With resolution of leukocytosis and clinical improvement, the patient was discharged with the chest tube in place and pediatric surgery outpatient follow-up.

Currently, there are no effective drugs approved for the treatment of JEV infection. Drug-repurposing screening is an alternative approach to discover potential antiviral agents. In this study, high-content screening (HCS) of a natural extracts library was performed, and two hit FDA-approved Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitors, ouabain and digoxin, were identified as having robust efficiency against JEV infection with the selectivity indexes over 1,000. The results indicated that ouabain and digoxin blocked the JEV infection at the replication stage by targeting the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Furthermore, it was proven that ouabain significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality caused by JEV in a BALB/c mouse model. This work demonstrated that Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase could serve as the target of treatment of JEV infection, and ouabain has the potential to be developed as an effective anti-JEV drug.","e9c51ce7b8c15bff3f9cb4de5afc2c862d5544bf","True","Antimicrob Agents Chemother","Japanese|JEV|HCS|two|FDA|JEV|over 1,000|JEV|JEV|BALB/","cc-by","","PMC7038234","31871089","NORP|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 21","","10.1128/AAC.02373-19","comm_use_subset"

This complex is crucial to the host's defense against microbes as it promotes IL-1β and IL-18 secretion and induces pyroptosis. NLRP3 recognizes variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) generated during viral replication that triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent antiviral immune responses and facilitates viral eradication. Meanwhile, several viruses have evolved elaborate strategies to evade the immune system by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome. In this review, we will focus on the crosstalk between the NLRP3 inflammasome and viruses, provide an overview of viral infection-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the immune escape strategies of viruses through their modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome activity.","372caa549b07492de5fd7064e9cadc62bef0f478","True","Front Immunol","NACHT|LRR|PYD|3|NOD|NLRP3|ASC|caspase-1|PAMPs|NLRP3|NLRP3","cc-by","","PMC7040071","32133002","ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON","PMC","2020 Feb 18","","10.3389/fimmu.2020.00211","comm_use_subset"

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the host innate immune response to PEDV infection. The expression dynamics of antiviral genes (e.g., RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-α, IFN-β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12) in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells were analyzed following PEDV stimulation. The results showed that the expression of antiviral genes (e.g., PKR, OAS1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-α and TNF-α) were significantly reduced within 0–4 h post-infection (P < 0.05). However, all antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated from 12 to 24 h (P < 0.05), and cytopathic changes were observed during this time. The expression of RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 were significantly and positively correlated to each other during the entire infection (P < 0.01). The results suggested that the RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 genes may play an important role in PEDV infection in piglets. Initially, PEDV displayed cellular invasion by inhibiting IFN-α transcription and interfering with the antiviral function of PKR, OAS1, and Mx2, ultimately induced an intense inflammatory response. The relationship between antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines with PEDV infection at the cellular level provides a reference for studying the mechanism of resistance to PEDV infection in piglets.","b6c38211730ff7826aa6a52aff9e3be848f8e738","True","Front Vet Sci","RIG-1|PKR|IFN-α|IFN-β|TNF-α|IL-6|IL-8|IPEC-J2|PKR|IFN-α|TNF-α|0–4|0.05|12|24|0.05|RIG-1|PKR|0.01|RIG-1|PKR|IFN-α|PKR","cc-by","","PMC7040077","32133381","ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 18","","10.3389/fvets.2020.00075","comm_use_subset"
"Whittaker, Gary R.; Straus, Marco R.","Human matriptase/ST 14 proteolytically cleaves H7N9 hemagglutinin and facilitates the activation of influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus in cell culture","BACKGROUND: Influenza is a zoonotic disease that infects millions of people each year resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths, and in turn devastating pandemics. Influenza is caused by influenza viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). There are many subtypes of IAV but only a few seem to be able to adapt to humans and to cause disease. In 2013, an H7N9 IAV subtype emerged in China that does not cause clinical symptoms in its chicken host but leads to severe infections when transmitted into humans. Since 2013, there have been six epidemic waves of H7N9 with 1567 laboratory‐confirmed human infections and 615 deaths. Pathogenicity of IAV is complex, but a crucial feature contributing to virulence is the activation of the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein by host proteases that triggers membrane fusion and leads to subsequent virus propagation. METHODS: 293T, VERO, and MDCK cells were used to conduct Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and pseudoparticle and live virus infections, and to evaluate H7N9 HA cleavage‐activation. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: We show that human matriptase/ST 14 is able to cleave H7N9 HA. Cleavage of H7N9 HA expressed in cell culture results in fusogenic HA and syncytia formation. In infection studies with viral pseudoparticles carrying matriptase/ST 14‐activated H7N9 HA, we observed a high infectivity of cells. Finally, human matriptase/ST 14 also activated H7N9 live virus which resulted in high infectivity. Our data demonstrate that human matriptase/ST 14 is a likely candidate protease to promote H7N9 infections in humans.","3fd4c59ae94e2ecc44c0c40d678dd18e31ddb7c7","True","Influenza Other Respir Viruses","Influenza|millions|each year|hundreds of thousands|Influenza|2013|China|2013|six|1567|615|METHODS|293|MDCK|Western|H7N9 HA cleavage‐activation|14|14|14","cc-by","","PMC7040964","31820577","ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE","PMC","2020 Mar 9","","10.1111/irv.12707","comm_use_subset"

METHODS: A total of 112 UP patients in Shanghai, China, were enrolled prospectively and assessed using the FA‐RP from October 2016 to March 2018. We examined the test results and their influence on clinical decisions. Furthermore, as a control group, we retrospectively obtained the clinical data of 70 UP patients between October 2014 and March 2016 (before the FA‐RP was available). The two patient groups were compared with respect to factors, including general antimicrobial use and defined daily dose (DDD) numbers. RESULTS: Between October 2016 and March 2018, the positive rate obtained using FA‐RP for UP was 76.8%. The primary pathogens in adults with UP were Influenza A/B (47.3%, 53/112). Compared with the patients before FA‐RP was available, patients who underwent FA‐RP testing had higher rates of antiviral drug use and antibiotic de‐escalation during clinical treatment. FA‐RP significantly decreased the total DDDs of antibiotic or antifungal drugs DDDs by 7 days after admission (10.6 ± 2.5 vs 14.1 ± 8.8, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The FA‐RP is a rapid and sensitive nucleic acid amplification test method for UP diagnosis in adults. The application of FA‐RP may lead to a more accurately targeted antimicrobial treatment and reduced use of antibiotic/antifungal drugs.","0293ec2b1cf8097392297cffd06854d2f37348f4","True","Influenza Other Respir Viruses","the FilmArray Respiratory Panel|METHODS|112|UP|Shanghai|China|from October 2016 to March 2018|70|UP|between October 2014 and March 2016|two|daily|DDD|Between October 2016 and March 2018|UP|76.8%|UP|Influenza|47.3%|53/112|7 days|10.6 ± 2.5|14.1 ±|8.8","cc-by","","PMC7040966","31786832","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|MONEY|MONEY|CARDINAL","PMC","2020 Mar 1","","10.1111/irv.12701","comm_use_subset"

Seed viruses for cell‐based vaccines can be prepared from clinical specimens by cell culture; however, clinical samples risk harboring respiratory viruses other than influenza virus. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the patterns of co‐infection in clinical samples and explore whether cell culture technology can selectively propagate influenza viruses from samples containing other respiratory viruses. METHODS: A total of 341 clinical specimens were collected from patients with influenza or influenza‐like illness and analyzed by ResPlex II assay to detect 18 respiratory viruses. The patterns of co‐infection were statistically analyzed with Fisher's exact test. The samples with double or triple infections were passaged in suspension MDCK cells (MDCK‐S), adherent MDCK cells (MDCK‐A), and LLC‐MK2D cells. Cell‐passaged samples were analyzed by ResPlex II assay again to investigate whether each cell line could amplify influenza viruses and eliminate other respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Double infections were detected in 8.5% and triple infections in 0.9% of the collected clinical specimens. We identified four pairs of viruses with significant correlation. For all samples with double and triple infection, MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A could selectively propagate influenza viruses, while eliminating all contaminating viruses. In contrast, LLC‐MK2D showed lower isolation efficiency for influenza virus and higher isolation efficiency for coxsackievirus/echovirus than MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A. CONCLUSIONS: Both MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A are considered suitable for the preparation of influenza vaccine seed viruses without adventitious agents or egg‐adaptation mutations.","98aca16ac6513c25abcf54bc1dbe7b6fe65e9c49","True","Influenza Other Respir Viruses","341|ResPlex II|18|Fisher|MDCK|MDCK|LLC‐MK2D|ResPlex II|8.5%|0.9%|four|LLC‐MK2D","cc-by","","PMC7040968","31651085","CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|NORP|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERSON","PMC","2020 Mar 25","","10.1111/irv.12694","comm_use_subset"

OBJECTIVE: To describe a pilot surveillance program established in health facilities in Yaoundé, Cameroon in 2017 which aimed to enable detection and reporting of public health events. METHODS: Cameroon’s Ministry of Health, in partnership with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cameroon Pasteur Center, and National Public Health Laboratory, implemented event‐based surveillance (EBS) in nine Yaoundé health facilities. Four signals were defined that could indicate possible public health events, and a reporting, triage, and verification system was established among partner organizations. A pre‐defined laboratory algorithm was defined, and a series of workshops trained health facilities, laboratory, and public health staff for surveillance implementation. RESULTS: From May 2017 to January 2018, 30 signals were detected, corresponding to 15 unusual respiratory events. All health facilities reported a signal at least once, and more than three‐quarters of health facilities reported ≥2 times. Among specimens tested, the pathogens detected included Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus aureus, Pneumocystis jiroveci, influenza A (H1N1) virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus. CONCLUSIONS: The events detected in this pilot were caused by routine respiratory bacteria and viruses, and no novel influenza viruses or other emerging respiratory threats were identified. The surveillance system, however, strengthened relationships and communication linkages between health facilities and public health authorities. Astute clinicians can play a critical role in early detection and EBS is one approach that may enable reporting of emerging outbreaks and public health events.","6a8d67876f9d695b2ad3251846bb303a9cc46ba1","True","Influenza Other Respir Viruses","The International Health Regulations|Yaoundé|Cameroon|2017|Cameroon|Ministry of Health|the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|National Public Health Laboratory|EBS|nine|Yaoundé|Four|May 2017 to January 2018|30|15|Klebsiella|Moraxella|Streptococcus|Haemophilus|Staphylococcus|Pneumocystis|H1N1|EBS|one","cc-by","","PMC7040971","31923349","ORG|PERSON|WORK_OF_ART|DATE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|NORP|ORG|GPE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL","PMC","2020 Mar 10","","10.1111/irv.12684","comm_use_subset"

We aimed to compare with a monocentric study the impact of late viral and bacterial respiratory infections on the graft function. METHODS: Patients, who survived 6 months or more following lung transplantation that took place between 2009 and 2014, were classified into three groups: a viral infection group (VIG) (without any respiratory bacteria), a bacterial infection group (BIG) (with or without any respiratory viruses), and a control group (CG) (no documented infection). Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and acute rejection were analysed 6 months after the inclusion in the study. RESULTS: Among 99 included lung recipients, 57 (58%) had at least one positive virological respiratory sample during the study period. Patients were classified as follows: 38 in the VIG, 25 in the BIG (among which 19 co-infections with a virus) and 36 in the CG. The BIG presented a higher initial deterioration in lung function (p = 0.05) than the VIG. But 6 months after the infection, only the VIG presented a median decrease of forced expiratory volume in 1 s; − 35 mL (IQR; − 340; + 80) in the VIG, + 140 mL (+ 60;+ 330) in the BIG and + 10 (− 84;+ 160) in the CG, p < 0.01. Acute rejection was more frequent in the VIG (n = 12 (32%)), than the BIG (n = 6 (24%)) and CG (n = 3 (8%)), p < 0.05, despite presenting no more CLAD (p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a less severe initial presentation, single viral respiratory infections seem to lead to a greater deterioration in lung function, and to more acute rejection, than bacterial infections.","1e0851ed44e0459ff83448af23b81560a41ede72","True","BMC Infect Dis","6 months or more|between 2009 and 2014|three|VIG|BIG|CG|CLAD|6 months|99|57|58%|at least one|38|VIG|25|BIG|19|36|CG|BIG|0.05|VIG|6 months|VIG|1|35 mL|340|80|VIG|140|330|BIG|10|84;+ 160|CG|0.01|Acute|VIG|12|32%|BIG|6|24%|CG|3|8%|0.05|0.21","cc-by","","PMC7041086","32093612","DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|TIME|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","PMC","2020 Feb 24","","10.1186/s12879-020-4877-3","comm_use_subset"

Methods: We studied 124 children <2 years old that were hospitalized for ALRI. Nutritional status was calculated by z-scores according to weight-for-age z-scores, length or height-for-age z-scores, and weight-for-height z-scores. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were obtained and viral respiratory pathogens were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) load was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR. NPA and plasma leptin level were measured. Clinical data and nutritional status were recorded, and patients were followed up until hospital discharge. Viral coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more viruses detected in the same respiratory sample. Severity of illness was determined by length of hospitalization and duration of oxygen therapy. Results: Children with overnutrition showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection than those with normal weight (71% obese vs. 37% normal weight p = 0.013; 68% overweight vs. 37% normal weight p = 0.004). A lower RSV load was found in obese (5.91 log(10) copies/mL) and overweight children (6.49 log(10) copies/mL) compared to normal weight children (8.06 log(10) copies/mL; p = 0.021 in both cases). In multivariate analysis, obese, and overweight infants <6 months old were associated with longer hospital stays (RR = 1.68; CI: 1.30–2.15 and obese: RR = 1.68; CI: 1.01–2.71, respectively) as well as a greater duration of oxygen therapy (RR = 1.80; IC: 1.41–2.29 and obese: RR = 1.91; CI: 1.15–3.15, respectively). Obese children <6 months showed higher plasma leptin level than normal weight children (7.58 vs. 5.12 ng/μl; p <0.046). Conclusions: In infants younger than 6 months, overnutrition condition was related to increased severity of infections and high plasma leptin level. Also, children with overnutrition showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection and low RSV viral load compared to normal weights children. These findings further contribute to the already existent evidence supporting the importance of overnutrition prevention in pediatric populations.","44a5bfa3f7ab0f7df199e81440995ab24b8e1c58","True","Front Pediatr","ALRIs|124|2 years old|ALRI|Nasopharyngeal|RT-PCR|RSV|RT-PCR|NPA|Clinical|two|71%|37%|0.013|68%|37%|RSV|5.91|6.49|8.06|0.021|6 months old|RR|1.68|CI|1.30–2.15|RR|1.68|CI|1.01–2.71|RR|1.80|IC|1.41–2.29|RR|1.91|CI|Obese|<6 months|7.58|5.12|ng/μl|0.046|6 months|RSV","cc-by","","PMC7041426","32133330","ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|NORP|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 18","","10.3389/fped.2020.00044","comm_use_subset"

Through their diverse polysaccharide structures they can potentiate a myriad of cellular signaling pathways involved in development, growth, immuno-communication and survival. Not surprisingly, disruption of glycan synthesis is fundamental to various human diseases; including cancer, where aberrant glycosylation drives malignancy. Here, we report the discovery of a novel mannose-binding lectin, ML6, which selectively recognizes and binds to these irregular tumor-specific glycans to elicit potent and rapid cancer cell death. This lectin was engineered from gene models identified in a tropical rainforest tree root transcriptome and is unusual in its six canonical mannose binding domains (QxDxNxVxY), each with a unique amino acid sequence. Remarkably, ML6 displays antitumor activity that is >10(5) times more potent than standard chemotherapeutics, while being almost completely inactive towards non-transformed, healthy cells. This activity, in combination with results from glycan binding studies, suggests ML6 differentiates healthy and malignant cells by exploiting divergent glycosylation pathways that yield naïve and incomplete cell surface glycans in tumors. Thus, ML6 and other high-valence lectins may serve as novel biochemical tools to elucidate the glycomic signature of different human tumors and aid in the rational design of carbohydrate-directed therapies. Further, understanding how nature evolves proteins, like ML6, to combat the changing defenses of competing microorganisms may allow for fundamental advances in the way we approach combinatorial therapies to fight therapeutic resistance in cancer.","d45434768bff438c55a2ec36d9821e40fe7ddc7d","True","PLoS One","Glycans|six|10(5","cc-by","","PMC7041804","32097449","NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","PMC","2020 Feb 25","","10.1371/journal.pone.0229467","comm_use_subset"
"Qi, Shanshan; Zhao, Jianjun; Guo, Donghua; Sun, Dongbo","A Mini-Review on the Epidemiology of Canine Parvovirus in China","Canine viral diarrhea is a severe disease in dogs worldwide. The role of canine parvovirus (CPV) in canine viral diarrhea is a common health problem in dogs, attracting major concern from veterinarians and dog owners across China. In this mini-review, we summarize the CPV epidemiology in China, including its origin, prevalence, coinfection, and the genetic evolution of the virus. The review reveals the correlation between CPV-2 infection and seasonality, a dog's age/gender/breed/vaccination; that CPV-2 is the main causative agent of canine diarrhea in Northeast China and that coinfection with other pathogens is a common occurrence; the predominant CPV epidemic strains were the new CPV-2a, and CPV-2c has shown significant growth trends since 2010. This mini-review will provide valuable information for CPV infections across China and other countries.","c4943b5cc55140da6a5bbf9e5ecb5d6729f0728d","True","Front Vet Sci","China|CPV|China|CPV-2|CPV-2|Northeast China|CPV|CPV-2c|2010|CPV|China","cc-by","","PMC7044151","","GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|LOC|ORG|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE","PMC","2020 Feb 20","","10.3389/fvets.2020.00005","comm_use_subset"

MiRNAs contribute to RNA virus pathogenesis by promoting antiviral immune response, enhancing viral replication, or altering miRNA-mediated host gene regulation. Thus, exploration of the virus–miRNA interactions occurring in PHEV-infected host may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms combating the virus life cycle or pathogenesis. Here, we discovered that the expression of miR-10a-5p was constitutively up-regulated by PHEV in both the N2a cells in vitro and mice brain in vivo. Treatment with miR-10a-5p mimics allowed miR-10a-5p enrichment and resulted in a significant restriction in PHEV replication, suggesting widespread negative regulation of the RNA virus infection by miR-10a-5p. The outcomes were also evidenced by miR-10a-5p inhibitor over-expression. Luciferase reporter, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting analysis further showed that Syndecan 1 (SDC1), a cell surface proteoglycan associated with host defense mechanisms, acts as a target gene of miR-10a-5p during PHEV infection. Naturally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SDC1 leads to a reduction in viral replication, implying that SDC1 expression is likely a favorable condition for viral replication. Together, the findings demonstrated that the abundant miR-10a-5p leads to downstream suppression of SDC1, and it functions as an antiviral mechanism in the PHEV-induced disease, providing a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of PHEV infection in the future work.","3078165241b24fed34596efa9f563661f1caa00c","True","Front Microbiol","PHEV|RNA|microRNA|miRNA|RNA|PHEV|miR-10a-5p|PHEV|N2a|miR-10a-5p|miR-10a-5p|PHEV|RNA|miR-10a-5p|miR-10a-5p|miR-10a-5p|PHEV|PHEV|PHEV","cc-by","","PMC7044266","","PERSON|ORG|PERSON|TIME|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|NORP|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON","PMC","2020 Feb 20","","10.3389/fmicb.2020.00105","comm_use_subset"

Intestinal microbiota play an important role in chicken health and contribute to the defence against colonization by invading pathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate the link between the intestinal microbiome and nephropathogenic IBV (NIBV) infection. Initially, chickens were randomly distributed into 2 groups: the normal group (INC) and the infected group (IIBV). The ilea were collected for morphological assessment, and the ileal contents were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The results of the IIBV group analyses showed a significant decrease in the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (P < 0.05), while the goblet cells increased compared to those in the INC group. Furthermore, the microbial diversity in the ilea decreased and overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae and underrepresentation of Chloroplast and Clostridia was found in the NIBV-infected chickens. In conclusion, these results showed that the significant separation of the two groups and the characterization of the gut microbiome profiles of the chickens with NIBV infection may provide valuable information and promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of this disease.","9d63191505e7cdb2dc1436228923fc97515e2ea1","True","Sci Rep","IBV|Coronaviridae|IBV|NIBV|2|INC|IIBV|IIBV|0.05|INC|Enterobacteriaceae|Chloroplast|Clostridia|NIBV|two|NIBV","cc-by","","PMC7044311","32103130","ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 26","","10.1038/s41598-020-60564-8","comm_use_subset"

One example includes adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), that are extensively detected in several animals, especially primates. To understand AAVs distribution and genetic diversity in the coastal areas of Southeast China, a total of 415 intestine samples were mostly collected from two provinces of southeast China, i.e., Zhejiang and Fujian province. Intestine samples from five bat species were collected for AAVs detection. The average prevalence rate for AAV detection among these samples was 18.6% (77 positives out of 415 samples) and ranged from 11.8 to 28.9% between the five bat species. This suggests that AAVs are widely distributed in diverse bat populations in southeast coastal areas of China. Based on the genome sequence of bat adeno-associated virus-CXC1(BtAAV-CXC1) from one AAV-positive sample, the genetic diversity of the detected AAVs were assessed and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BtAAV-CXC1 was comparatively distant to other major AAVs from mammals and non-mammals, with only a 52.9~64.7% nucleotide identity. However, they were phylogenetically closer to Rhinolophus sinicus bat adeno-associated virus (Rs-BtAAV1), with a 74.5% nt similarity. Partial analysis of the rep and cap overlapping open reading frame (ORF) sequences from bat AAV samples revealed 48 partial rep sequences and 23 partial cap sequences from positive samples shared 86.9 to 100% and 72.3 to 98.8% nucleotide identities among themselves, respectively. This suggests that the detected AAVs had a distinctly high genetic diversity. These findings led us to conclude that diverse AAVs may be widely distributed in bat populations from the southeast regions of China.","3e4de1d7982eb2ce67d340a63175adfdab398686","True","Sci Rep","One|Southeast China|415|two|China|Zhejiang|Fujian|five|AAV|18.6%|77|415|11.8 to|28.9%|five|China|CXC1(BtAAV|one|AAV|52.9~64.7%|74.5%|ORF|AAV|48|23|86.9 to 100%|72.3|98.8%|China","cc-by","","PMC7048818","32111911","CARDINAL|LOC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE","PMC","2020 Feb 28","","10.1038/s41598-020-60721-z","comm_use_subset"

The etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to use Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay tests in a routine setting for exact and fast identification. OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we present the clinical results of pediatric pneumonia and describe their etiology by using molecular diagnosis. Study design: Tracheal secretion was collected from infants presenting respiratory distress isolated or associated with systemic signs, attending the unit of Neonatology between December 1, 2016, and Mai 31, 2018. Samples were tested with the multiplex RespiFinder® SMART 22 FAST which potentially detects 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. RESULTS: Of the 86 infants considered in this study (mean age 31 ± 19 days) suspected of acute respiratory tract infections, 71 (83%) were positive for one or multiple viruses or/and bacteria. The majority of acute respiratory tract infections had a viral origin (95%): respiratory syncytial viruses (A and B) (49%), rhinovirus (21%), coronaviruses 229E (11%), humain metapneumovirus (5%), influenza A (3%), influenza H1N1 (1%), adenovirus (2%), and parainfluenza virus type 4 (2%). Among our patients, 6% had Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coinfections were not associated with severe respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: The clinical spectrum of respiratory infections is complex and often nonspecific. Thus, the early and fast detection of related causative agents is crucial. The use of multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction may help choose an accurate treatment, reduce the overall use of unnecessary antibiotics, preserve intestinal flora, and decrease nosocomial infection by reducing the length of hospitalization.","7e0925a800d4d09380ac44584b5be257d83531d3","True","Adv Virol","Morocco|first|Multiplex|Tracheal|between December 1, 2016|2018|RespiFinder|SMART 22 FAST|18|4|86|age 31|19 days|71|83%|one|95%|49%|21%|229E|11%|5%|3%|H1N1|1%|2%|4|2%|6%|Mycoplasma","cc-by","","PMC7049438","32148499","GPE|ORDINAL|NORP|PRODUCT|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON","PMC","2020 Feb 18","","10.1155/2020/6212643","comm_use_subset"

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first recognized in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The clinical presentations of MERS and non-MERS SARI are often similar. Therefore, the identification of suspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of MERS-CoV is essential. However, the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers. The nature of these markers has not previously been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence, this study aims to identify them. METHODS: It was a surveillance system-based study, for which data from a total of 23,646 suspected patients in Riyadh and Al Qassim regions were analyzed from January 2017 until December 2017 to estimate the prevalence of MERS-CoV among suspected cases and to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results. These confirmed cases (67.2% of which were males) had a mean age of 43.23 years (SD ± 22.8). Around 42.2% of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47% of confirmed cases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer. The study identified three significant and independent predictors for confirmation of the disease: an age between 41 and 60 years, male gender, and summer season admission. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and management of such a contagious disease. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions of Saudi Arabia as well and explore potential preventable risk factors.","edee452881f826fb72c58ee68a982789b12aa99d","True","Biomed Res Int","Middle East|first|September 2012|Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia|23,646|Riyadh|Al Qassim|January 2017|December 2017|CoV|23,646|119|0.5%|67.2%|43.23 years|SD ±|22.8|Around 42.2%|between 41 and 60 years|about 47%|the summer|three|60 years|summer season|CoV|Saudi Arabia","cc-by","","PMC7049846","32149148","LOC|ORDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|PERSON|GPE","PMC","2020 Feb 19","","10.1155/2020/9629747","comm_use_subset"

However, its expression and function in breast cancer cells has yet to be studied. Therefore, RNA in situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of HEPIS in breast cancer and cancer-adjacent normal breast tissue. HEPIS was expressed at lower levels in breast cancer compared with that in adjacent normal tissue. Subcellular localization of HEPIS was mainly found in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine cell proliferation assays were used to investigate the role of HEPIS in cancer cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of HEPIS in MCF-7 cells was found to significantly inhibit cell proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of HEPIS by RNA interference exhibited the opposite effect. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed and HEPIS overexpression specifically inhibited the activity of the NF-κB reporter gene. Results of the gene chip assay revealed that 2,231 genes were differentially expressed in HEPIS-overexpressing cells. Results of the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses indicated that these genes were enriched in the ‘mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway’, ‘JAK-STAT signaling pathway’ and ‘focal adhesion’. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to confirm the expression levels of the differentially expressed genes interleukin 2 receptor subunit α (IL2RA), interferon α and β receptor subunit 2 (IFNAR2) and IFα8 (IFNA8). In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that HEPIS may function as a potential repressor of breast cancer.","faec4bca24cb275ebc6c55e7cba3bd6a3b74df32","True","Oncol Lett","protein-10 (HEPIS|RNA|HEPIS|HEPIS|HEPIS|HeLa|Cell Counting Kit-8|HEPIS|HEPIS|MCF-7|HEPIS|RNA|HEPIS|NF-κB|2,231|HEPIS|the Gene Ontology|Kyoto Encyclopedia|Genes|Genomes|JAK-STAT|2|2|IFNA8|HEPIS","cc-by-nc-nd","","PMC6865829","31788121","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|LOC|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|GPE|PERSON|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 17","","10.3892/ol.2019.10993","noncomm_use_subset"

METHODS: In this multicenter nationwide study a total of 971 HCT procedures (741 allo-HCT; 230 auto-HCT) over a period of 6 years were analyzed. RESULTS: During this period 801 episodes of viral infections were diagnosed in 442 patients. The incidence of viral infections was 57.9% in allo-HCT and 4.8% in auto-HCT patients. The most frequent infections after allo-HCT were caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), polyoma BK virus (BKV) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). The majority of infections occurred within the first 4 months after allo-HCT and over 80% required pharmacotherapy or symptomatic therapy. The median time of treatment of specific viral infection ranged from 7 (for EBV) to 24 (for CMV) days. The highest mortality was observed in case of CMV infection. The risk factors for viral infections were allo-HCT, acute leukemia, acute and chronic graft versus host disease (a/cGVHD), and matched unrelated donor (MUD)/mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD)-HCT. The risk factor for death from viral infection were CMV-IgG seropositivity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia recipient, and MUD/MMUD-HCT. The incidence of EBV infection requiring pre-emptive treatment with rituximab in allo-HCT children was 19.3%. In 30.8% cases of EBV infection, these episodes were preceded by other viral infection and treated with antivirals, which did not prevent development of EBV-DNA-emia with need of rituximab treatment in 81.5% cases. In 47.7% of these cases, GVHD was a factor enabling development of significant EBV-DNA-emia during antiviral therapy of other infection.

Knowledge about current cause of respiratory infections is lacking, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to identity the various respiratory pathogens causing acute respiratory tract infections in children below 5 years of age visiting a sub-urban primary care clinic in Senegal. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in September and October 2018. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from cases; infants with fever and respiratory symptoms, and controls; children involved in the vaccination programme. Viral identification was conducted by polymerase chain reaction for 21 different viruses; bacteria were identified by culture studies. Associations between microorganisms, acute respiratory infection and severity of disease were calculated by multivariate regression adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, and living area. RESULTS: Overall, 102 cases and 96 controls were included. Microorganisms were detected in 90.1% of cases and 53.7% of controls (P < .001). Influenza virus A (including H1N1), influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Streptococcus pneumoniae were independently associated with acute respiratory tract infections. Co-detection of two or more pathogens was present in 49.5% of cases; 31.7% of cases had a pneumonia and 90.2% was treated with antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This case-control study in a primary care setting in sub-Saharan Africa found influenza virus A and B, RSV, and S pneumoniae to be the main causes of acute respiratory tract infections in children below 5 years of age.

Although endocrine therapy is effective, the development of endocrine resistance is a major clinical challenge. The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor malignancy, and tumor‐associated macrophages (TAM) within the TME play a crucial role in endocrine resistance. Herein, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between TAM and the endocrine‐resistant phenotype of breast cancer. Macrophages were cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from tamoxifen‐sensitive (MCF7‐S) or ‐resistant (MCF7‐R) MCF7 breast cancer cells. M2 polarization was detected by CD163 immunofluorescence. To determine the effect on endocrine resistance, MCF7 cells were cultured in the supernatant of different TAM, and then treated with tamoxifen. CC‐chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) immunohistochemistry was carried out on pathological sections from 100 patients with invasive estrogen receptor‐positive breast cancer. We found that macrophages cultured in the CM of MCF7‐S and MCF7‐R cells were induced into TAM, with a more obvious M2 polarization in the latter. Tamoxifen resistance was increased by culture in TAM medium. TAM secreted CCL2, which increased endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells through activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. High expression of CCL2 was correlated with infiltration of CD163+macrophages (r = 0.548, P < .001), and patients with high CCL2 expression presented shorter progression‐free survival than those with low CCL2 expression (P < .05). We conclude that CCL2 secreted by TAM activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and promotes an endocrine resistance feedback loop in the TME, suggesting that CCL2 and TAM may be novel therapeutic targets for patients with endocrine‐resistant breast cancer.","17f00e096a5f3ce94278a77011e6f38d7a47c618","True","Cancer Sci","Breast|TAM|Herein|TAM|Macrophages|CM|CD163|TAM|100|receptor‐positive|the CM of MCF7‐S|TAM|M2|Tamoxifen|TAM|TAM|Akt/|progression‐free|TAM|Akt|TAM","cc-by-nc","","PMC6942430","31710162","ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|GPE|FAC|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 19","","10.1111/cas.14230","noncomm_use_subset"

To clarify the frequency of viral pneumonia among patients with acute progressive clinical courses that required a differential diagnosis between ILDs and pneumonia, and to determine the most frequent ILDs misdiagnosed in cases of viral pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients hospitalized from 2010 to 2017 with an acute clinical course (≤30 days) who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for the differential diagnosis of infection and ILDs. We performed a multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses using the patients' preserved BAL fluid. The final diagnosis was made by a multidisciplinary approach and after considering the PCR results. The diagnosis at discharge was compared to the final diagnosis. RESULTS: Among the 109 patients, 53 were diagnosed with viral pneumonia. Viral pneumonia and other diseases showed some differences in symptoms and laboratory data; however, the differences were small or overlapped. Viral pneumonia was misdiagnosed on discharge as acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (AFOP/COP/CEP) (n=22), acute interstitial pneumonia (n=5), connective tissue disease-related ILDs (n=3), unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia (n=2), drug-induced ILD (n=1), and pneumonia (n=20). CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the patients who underwent BAL had viral pneumonia. The most common ILD-related misdiagnoses were AFOP/COP/CEP. Differences in symptoms and laboratory findings between viral pneumonia and other diseases were small, and viral pneumonia should be included in the differential diagnosis when physicians encounter cases in which the abovementioned ILDs are suspected.","5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9","True","Intern Med","2010|2017|BAL|BAL|109|53|AFOP/COP/CEP|n=22|Approximately half|BAL|AFOP/COP/CEP","cc-by-nc-nd","","PMC6949447","31839671","DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 15","","10.2169/internalmedicine.2696-19","noncomm_use_subset"

METHODS: Viability, apoptosis and LRP2 level in TPC-1 cells treated with different doses of metformin for different time points were determined. Besides, protein levels of p-JNK1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in metformin-treated TPC-1 cells were detected by Western blot. Regulatory effects of LRP2 on the JNK pathway and cell viability in metformin-treated TPC-1 cells were assessed. RESULTS: Viability in TPC-1 cells gradually decreased with the treatment of increased doses of metformin either for 24 h or 48 h. The apoptotic rate was concentration-dependently elevated by metformin treatment. Relative levels of LRP2 and p-JNK1 were concentration-dependently downregulated by metformin treatment. In addition, overexpression of LRP2 partially abolished the inhibitory effect of metformin on the viability of TPC-1 cells.

"Kaboudi, Khaled","Virus-induced immunosuppression in turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo): A review","Immunosuppression is characterized by a dysfunction of humoral and/or cellular immune response leading to increase of susceptibility to secondary infections, increase of mortality and morbidity, poor productivity, and welfare and vaccination failures. Humoral immune response depression is due to perturbation of soluble factors, as complement and chemokines in innate immunity and antibodies or cytokines in adaptive immunity. At the cellular immune response, immunosuppression is the consequence of the dysfunction of T-cells, B-cells, heterophils, monocytes, macrophages, and natural Killer cells. Immunosuppression in turkeys can be caused by numerous, non-infectious, and infectious agents, having variable pathological and molecular mechanisms. Interactions between them are very complex. This paper reviews the common viruses inducing clinical and sub-clinical immunosuppression in turkeys, and enteric and neoplastic viruses in particular, as well as the interactions among them. The evaluation of immunosuppression is currently based on classical approach; however, new technique such as the microarray technology is being developed to investigate immunological mediator’s genes detection. Controlling of immunosuppression include, in general, biosecurity practices, maintaining appropriate breeding conditions and vaccination of breeders and their progeny. Nevertheless, few vaccines are available against immunosuppressive viruses in turkey’s industry. The development of new control strategies is reviewed.","920ac358de68e48b50b4d65dc500935ade21c997","True","Open Vet J","Killer","cc-by-nc","","PMC6971353","32042658","PERSON","PMC","2020 Jan 25","","10.4314/ovj.v9i4.13","noncomm_use_subset"

OBJECTIVE: To determine the long‐term outcome of cats with AMG without evidence of a cranial mediastinal mass (CMM). ANIMALS: Eight cats diagnosed with AMG without evidence of a CMM. METHODS: Retrospective case series. The medical records of cats diagnosed with AMG between 2005 and 2018 from 2 veterinary referral hospitals were reviewed for inclusion. Inclusion criteria consisted of a diagnosis of AMG, thoracic imaging, serum biochemistry including measurement of creatine kinase, and a CBC. Exclusion criteria were the presence of an identifiable CMM, or administration of methimazole or carbimazole. RESULTS: All cats had an excellent long‐term outcome, achieving immune remission within 6 months of diagnosis, including 4 cats that did not receive any treatment and whose natural course of disease involved spontaneous remission. Clinical presentation was heterogeneous, and skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability induced or exacerbated by the wheelbarrow exercise stress test were the most consistent abnormalities associated with AMG. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Cats diagnosed with AMG without evidence a CMM have a favorable outcome and frequently achieve immune remission. Moreover, the natural history of AMG in cats includes spontaneous remission when there is no evidence of a CMM. Attempting to rule out the presence of a CMM therefore refines prognosis, and treatment is not always necessary in this disease population.","cfe337afa069a02e96adf6894819e7928f8c4534","True","J Vet Intern Med","AMG|AMG|CMM|ANIMALS|Eight|AMG|CMM|METHODS|AMG|between 2005 and 2018|2|AMG|CBC|CMM|6 months|4|AMG|CLINICAL|AMG|CMM|AMG|CMM|CMM","cc-by-nc-nd","","PMC6979264","31746510","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Nov 20 Jan-Feb","","10.1111/jvim.15655","noncomm_use_subset"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the antiviral effects of ZrO(2) on H5N1 virus were assessed in vivo, and the molecular mechanism responsible for this protection was investigated. RESULTS: Mice treated with 200 nm positively-charged NPs at a dose of 100 mg/kg showed higher survival rates and smaller reductions in weight. 200 nm ZrO(2) activated mature dendritic cells and initially promoted the expression of cytokines associated with the antiviral response and innate immunity. In the lungs of H5N1-infected mice, ZrO(2) treatment led to less pathological lung injury, significant reduction in influenza A virus replication, and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: This antiviral study using zirconia NPs shows protection of mice against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and suggests strong application potential for this method, introducing a new tool against a wide range of microbial infections.","11888535f2eb67c15d08783b164def90aa47a3bd","True","Int J Nanomedicine","ZrO(2|ZrO(2|H5N1|200|100|200|ZrO(2","cc-by-nc","","PMC6996547","32099358","PERSON|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON","PMC","2020 Jan 30","","10.2147/IJN.S221667","noncomm_use_subset"

We previously demonstrated that icariin, extracted from Herba Epimedii, sromotes osteogenic differentiation. However, the mechanism underlying the association between icariin and BMAL1 in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) remains unclear. The present study was designed with an aim to clarify the association between icariin and BMAL1 in osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), RUNX family transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and BMAL1 in BMSCs was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. ALP and Alizarin red S (ARS) staining were also performed. Icariin promoted BMSC proliferation, and upregulated expression of osteogenic genes and BMAL1. In addition, expression of the osteogenic genes BMP2, RUNX2, ALP and OC were upregulated by BMAL1 overexpression. Furthermore, we confirmed that BMAL1 deficiency suppressed osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs. Finally, ARS staining of BMAL1(−/−) BMSCs revealed that BMAL1 was an essential intermediary in matrix mineralization during osteogenic differentiation. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that icariin promoted osteogenic differentiation through BMAL1-BMP2 signaling in BMSCs. The present study thus described a novel target of icariin that has potential applications in the treatment of osteogenic disorders.","9c4444ada7a386ec68c8180c998e0b2ec44824d8","True","Mol Med Rep","ARNT|Herba Epimedii|BMAL1|BMAL1|Cell Counting Kit-8|2|BMP2|RUNX|2|RUNX2|ALP|OC|BMAL1|ALP|Alizarin red S|Icariin|BMSC|BMAL1|BMP2|RUNX2|ALP|OC|BMAL1|BMAL1|BMAL1","cc-by-nc-nd","","PMC7002972","32016461","ORG|PERSON|GPE|PERSON|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|PERSON","PMC","2020 Mar 20","","10.3892/mmr.2020.10954","noncomm_use_subset"

The emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009 caused a pandemic. Since then it has become a seasonal influenza virus. It causes symptoms ranging from mild to severe illness, which might be fatal, particularly in people with underlying chronic medical conditions, immunocompromised people, the elderly, and pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: Describe the data generated by the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 surveillance in Saudi Arabia from 2010 to 2016. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive. SETTING: Hospitals reporting to the Ministry of Health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied aggregate data on hospitalized cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2016. The surveillance system used the case definition proposed by the WHO. The cases were confirmed by performing the real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on upper respiratory samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Suspected and confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases. SAMPLE SIZE: 113 502 suspected H1N1 cases and 17 094 (15.1%) confirmed cases. RESULTS: Most of the reported cases were registered in the Riyadh region. During the period of the study, the highest number of confirmed cases, 9262 (54.2 %), was in 2015. The case fatality rate for confirmed cases was 3.6%. CONCLUSION: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 showed seasonal trends. The number of suspected influenza cases each year was proportionate to the number of confirmed cases for that year.

In this study, we investigated whether Vero cells could be grown in serum-free and shaking suspension conditions. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of the Vero cell suspension culture system to produce adenovirus type 5 (Ad5), compared to that of the adhesive Vero cell culture system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the feasibility of commercial serum-free media for Vero cell culture. For the adaptation of Vero cells in suspension culture, adhesive Vero cells were added in the early phase of shaking suspension culture, and 50 days after shaking suspension culture, suspension-adapted Vero cells were subcultured continuously. To assess the virus production ability of Vero cells in suspension, the cells were infected with Ad5-green fluorescent protein and evaluated based on their fluorescence intensity. RESULTS: The Vero cells grown in OptiPRO serum-free medium showed no changes in morphology and growth rate, but MRC-5 and FRhk-4 cells showed morphological changes and decreased growth rate, respectively. The Vero cells were well adapted to the suspension culture system. The Vero cells in suspension showed a better Ad5 production ability than the adherent Vero cells. CONCLUSION: Vero cells can be grown in OptiPRO serum-free medium. Further, our suspension culture-adapted Vero cells may be suitable to produce viral vaccine strains due to their high ability to produce viruses such as Ad5.","f0e75f3b4aeda66ce88ca4a58a785c8fdf32b9ab","True","Clin Exp Vaccine Res","Vero|Vero|5|Vero|Vero|Vero|Vero|50 days|Vero|Vero|Ad5-green|Vero|OptiPRO|Vero|Vero|Vero|Vero|OptiPRO|Vero","cc-by-nc","","PMC7024729","32095440","PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|DATE|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|PERSON","PMC","2020 Jan 31","","10.7774/cevr.2020.9.1.48","noncomm_use_subset"

Recoding events provide insights into alternative modes of ribosome dynamics that are potentially applicable to other non-canonical modes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.","ad3eea30652fd3de7debecd8a1c4723018a0a465","True","Nucleic Acids Res","one|three","cc-by-nc","","PMC7026636","31511883","CARDINAL|CARDINAL","PMC","2020 Feb 20","","10.1093/nar/gkz783","noncomm_use_subset"

"Nie, Kun-xi; Wang, Chan; Li, Xin-wu","Success of Big Infectious Disease Reimbursement Policy in China","Big infectious diseases do harm to the whole society, and it is highly crucial to control them on time. The major purpose of this article is to theoretically demonstrate that the Chinese government’s intervention in large-scale infectious diseases is successful and efficient. Two potential strategies were considered: strategy 1 was infectious disease without government intervention, and strategy 2 was infectious disease with government intervention. By evolution model, this article illustrates the efficiency of big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. Without government reimbursement, this article finds that high expenditures accelerate the disease infection. The number of infected persons decreases under big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. The higher the treatment costs, the more important the government intervention. Big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China can serve as an efficient example to cope with big infectious diseases.","dd215aa15c6f212275cacf2f9db5c2e8d4145217","True","Inquiry","Chinese|Two|1|2|China|China|China","cc-by-nc","","PMC7036499","32075479","NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE","PMC","2020 Feb 20","","10.1177/0046958020907788","noncomm_use_subset"
"Abiodun, Oyesiji A.; Ola, Mohammad Shamsul","Role of brain renin angiotensin system in neurodegeneration: An update","Renin angiotensin system (RAS) is an endocrine system widely known for its physiological roles in electrolyte homeostasis, body fluid volume regulation and cardiovascular control in peripheral circulation. However, brain RAS is an independent form of RAS expressed locally in the brain, which is known to be involved in brain functions and disorders. There is strong evidence for a major involvement of excessive brain angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/Angiotensin II (Ang II)/Angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT-1R) axis in increased activation of oxidative stress, apoptosis and neuroinflammation causing neurodegeneration in several brain disorders. Numerous studies have demonstrated strong neuroprotective effects by blocking AT1R in these brain disorders. Additionally, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Angiotensin (1–7)/Mas receptor (MASR), is another axis of brain RAS which counteracts the damaging effects of ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis on neurons in the brain. Thus, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and activation of ACE2/Angiotensin (1–7)/MASR axis may serve as an exciting and novel method for neuroprotection in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here in this review article, we discuss the expression of RAS in the brain and highlight how altered RAS level may cause neurodegeneration. Understanding the pathophysiology of RAS and their links to neurodegeneration has enormous potential to identify potentially effective pharmacological tools to treat neurodegenerative diseases in the brain.","9e90670ce5061438424bedfc1f400b75e3dea417","True","Saudi J Biol Sci","Renin|RAS|RAS|RAS|ACE)/Angiotensin II|enzyme 2|ACE2)/Angiotensin|MASR|RAS|ACE/Ang II/|RAS|RAS|RAS","cc-by-nc-nd","","PMC7042626","32127770","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|DATE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Mar 30","","10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.01.026","noncomm_use_subset"
"Eggers, Maren","Infectious Disease Management and Control with Povidone Iodine","With reports of vancomycin-resistant enterococci recently emerging in hospital settings, renewed focus is turning to the importance of multifaceted infection prevention efforts. Careful compliance with established hygiene practices by healthcare workers together with effective antiseptic options is essential for the protection of patients from infectious agents. For over 60 years, povidone iodine (PVP-I) formulations have been shown to limit the impact and spread of infectious diseases with potent antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal effects. In addition to a lack of reported resistance, the benefits of PVP-I include an excellent safety profile and a broad spectrum of effect due to its multimodal action. Studies have shown that hand washing with PVP-I-based antiseptics is effective for the decontamination of skin, while PVP-I mouthwashes and gargles significantly reduce viral load in the oral cavity and the oropharynx. The importance of PVP-I has been emphasised by its inclusion in the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines, and high potency for virucidal activity has been observed against viruses of significant global concern, including hepatitis A and influenza, as well as the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome and Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses. Together with its diverse applications in antimicrobial control, broad accessibility across the globe, and outstanding safety and tolerability profile, PVP-I offers an affordable, potent, and widely available antiseptic option.

"Akbar, Anzila; Albadw, Naseem; Racela, Brian; Damodaran, Chokkalinga; Mustafa, Emad; Coria, Roopa; Hassan, Ali; Saif Ibrahim, Abdulsalam","Safety of prone positioning in critically ill patients","Background: During the past two years, 5% of patients admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) of Hamad General Hospital (HGH) had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio less than 100 mmHg. The risks associated with this condition include ventilator associated lung injury, over distension of lungs, and poor gas exchange which results in increased morbidity and mortality. With quality improvement initiatives like prone positioning, the mortality and morbidity associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome(1) can be reduced by improving hypoxemia(2) with a significant enhancement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios while reducing injurious ventilation. Also, prone positioning can help prevent invasive interventions such as placing patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy.(3) Methods: We evaluated the safety of prone positioning for improving hypoxemia in critically ill patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 100 mmHg to PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 200 mmHg from 1(st) January 2017 to 31(st) December 2018, without major complications. Data collected included the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios based on arterial blood gases of mechanically ventilated patients before and after prone positioning. We were able to facilitate prone positioning in 72 out of 110 patients with severe ARDS having a total average PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of 84.4 ± 30 mmHg. The patients were proned for a maximum of 16 hours in each session where up to three sessions were incorporated. No major complications were encountered during the proning sessions. This was thought to be accomplished through the coordination of a dedicated multidisciplinary team, education and simulation classes for physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, following appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for prone positioning, and implementing quality measures through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles as represented in Figure 1. Results: The total average PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio before proning for 65% of patients (n = 72) with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome(4) was 84.4 ± 30 mmHg and after one hour of 16 hours proning, it improved to 180.3 ± 78 mmHg. The remaining 35% of patients either had traumatic fractures, unstable spinal injury, severe hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity together with ARDS which made them unfavorable for prone positioning. Out of those who were proned, 11 (12.5%) patients did not have improvement in oxygenation after proning due to non-recruitable lungs and were put on ECMO. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios before and after one hour of implementing the prone position technique in each quarter of 2017 and 2018 are represented in Figure 2. Conclusion: • Sustaining and standardizing the accomplished work of data collection. • Implementing the prone positioning technique across other critical care units of Hamad Medical Corporation. • Keeping a record of minor complications associated with prone positioning and resolving them in further sessions. • Documenting cases with contraindications to prone positioning.","7685358860b9b2a9d1dd54d63813a4f115814b85","True","Qatar Med J","the past two years|5%|the Medical Intensive Care Unit|Hamad General Hospital|HGH|ARDS|PaO(2)/FiO(2|less than 100|PaO(2)/FiO(2|PaO(2)/FiO(2|100 mmHg|PaO(2)/FiO(2|200|1(st)|January 2017 to 31(st|December 2018|PaO(2)/FiO(2|72|110|ARDS|PaO(2)/FiO(2|84.4 ± 30 mmHg|16 hours|up to three|Plan-Do-Study-Act|1|PaO(2)/FiO(2|65%|72|84.4 ± 30 mmHg|one hour|16 hours|180.3|±|78 mmHg|The remaining|35%|ARDS|11|12.5%|ECMO|PaO(2)/FiO(2|one hour|each quarter of 2017|2018|2|Hamad Medical Corporation","no-cc","","PMC6984011","","DATE|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|MONEY|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|MONEY|TIME|CARDINAL|EVENT|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|MONEY|TIME|TIME|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|TIME|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 27","","10.5339/qmj.2019.qccc.60","custom_license"

While some IBV strains replicate locally, others can disseminate to various organs, including the kidney. Here, we elucidate the determinants for kidney tropism by studying interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral attachment protein spike from two IBV strains with different tropisms. Recombinantly produced RBDs from the nephropathogenic IBV strain QX and from the nonnephropathogenic strain M41 bound to the epithelial cells of the trachea. In contrast, only QX-RBD binds more extensively to cells of the digestive tract, urogenital tract, and kidneys. While removal of sialic acids from tissues prevented binding of all proteins to all tissues, binding of QX-RBD to trachea and kidney could not be blocked by preincubation with synthetic alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids. The lack of binding of QX-RBD to a previously identified IBV-M41 receptor was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), demonstrating that tissue binding of QX-RBD is dependent on a different sialylated glycan receptor. Using chimeric RBD proteins, we discovered that the region encompassing amino acids 99 to 159 of QX-RBD was required to establish kidney binding. In particular, QX-RBD amino acids 110 to 112 (KIP) were sufficient to render IBV-M41 with the ability to bind to kidney, while the reciprocal mutations in IBV-QX abolished kidney binding completely. Structural analysis of both RBDs suggests that the receptor-binding site for QX is located at a different location on the spike than that of M41. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis virus is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis in chickens. Upon infection of chicken flocks, the poultry industry faces substantial economic losses by diminished egg quality and increased morbidity and mortality of infected animals. While all IBV strains infect the chicken respiratory tract via the ciliated epithelial layer of the trachea, some strains can also replicate in the kidneys, dividing IBV into the following two pathotypes: nonnephropathogenic (example, IBV-M41) and nephropathogenic viruses (including IBV-QX). Here, we set out to identify the determinants for the extended nephropathogenic tropism of IBV-QX. Our data reveal that each pathotype makes use of a different sialylated glycan ligand, with binding sites on opposite sides of the attachment protein. This knowledge should facilitate the design of antivirals to prevent coronavirus infections in the field.","","False","J Virol","IBV|RBD|two|IBV|IBV|QX|M41|QX-RBD|QX-RBD|QX-RBD|IBV|enzyme|ELISA|QX-RBD|RBD|99|159|QX-RBD|QX-RBD|110 to 112|KIP|IBV-M41|IBV-|QX|M41|IBV|IBV|two|IBV-M41|IBV-QX|IBV-QX","cc-by","","PMC6955270","31694947","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 6","","10.1128/JVI.01363-19",""

CRFK cells were of fusiform morphology and appeared similar to FCF. CRFK expressed the mesenchymal intermediate filament (IF) protein vimentin together with two cell adhesion molecules associated with feline fibroblasts (CD29 and CD44), and lacked expression of the epithelial IF cytokeratin, myogenic IF desmin and endothelial marker von Willebrand factor (vWF). In addition, CRFK did not demonstrate brush border enzyme activity typical of FPTEC. S100A4 gene expression, implicated in both neoplastic transformation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, was highly upregulated in CRFK in comparison to the primary feline renal cells. CRFK appear phenotypically similar to fibroblasts, rather than tubular epithelial cells, and may have undergone neoplastic transformation or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition after extensive passaging.

In vitro immune responses to rhinovirus infection in differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) sampled from patients with COPD were additionally evaluated. Patients were stratified as frequent exacerbators (≥2 exacerbations in the preceding year) or infrequent exacerbators (<2 exacerbations in the preceding year) with comparisons made between these groups. Frequent exacerbators had reduced sputum cell mRNA expression of the antiviral immune mediators type I and III interferons and reduced interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression when clinically stable and during virus-associated exacerbation. A role for epithelial cell-intrinsic innate immune dysregulation was identified: induction of interferons and ISGs during in vitro rhinovirus (RV) infection was also impaired in differentiated BECs from frequent exacerbators. Frequent exacerbators additionally had increased sputum bacterial loads at 2 wk following virus-associated exacerbation onset. These data implicate deficient airway innate immunity involving epithelial cells in the increased propensity to exacerbations observed in some patients with COPD.

The open reading frame 5 (ORF5) protein is a newly discovered non-structural protein in PCV2, which the function in viral pathogenesis remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of PCV2 ORF5 protein on autophagy and viral replication. The pEGFP-tagged ORF5 gene was ectopic expressed in PK-15 cells and an ORF5-deficient PCV2 mutant strain (PCV2(ΔORF5)) were used to infected PK-15 cells. This study demonstrated that the ORF5 is essential for the of PCV2-induced autophagy. The ORF5 protein triggers the phosphorylation of PERK, eIF2α and the expression of downstream transcription factor ATF4. In addition, ORF5 protein activated the AMPK-ERK1/2-mTOR signaling pathways. These findings suggest that ORF5 play essential roles in the induction of autophagy by PCV2. We further revealed that PCV2 ORF5 promotes viral replication through PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 and AMPK-ERK1/2-mTOR pathways.

Puerarin (PR), a major isoflavonoid isolated from the Chinese herb Gegen, possesses many pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral activities. This study was conducted with both PEDV-infected African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) and neonatal pigs to determine the effect of PR on PEDV infection and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by using proteomic analyses. Twenty-four piglets fed a milk replacer were randomly allocated into one of three groups (Control, PEDV, and PEDV + PR). After a 5-day period of adaption, piglets (n = 8/group) in the PEDV + PR were orally administered with PR (0.5 mg/kg body weight) between days 5 and 9, whereas piglets in the other two groups received the same volume of liquid milk replacer. On day 9, piglets were orally administered with either sterile saline or PEDV (Yunnan province strain) at 10(4.5) TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig. On day 12 of the trial, jugular vein blood and intestinal samples were collected. In addition, Vero cells were assigned randomly into three groups (Control, PEDV, PEDV + PR). Cells in the PEDV and PEDV + PR groups were infected with PEDV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01, while cells in the control group were treated with the same volume of sterile saline. One hour later, cells in the Control and PEDV groups were cultured in serum-free DMEM, while cells in the PEDV + PR group were supplemented with PR. After 36 h of culture, cells were harvested. PR attenuated the reductions in cell proliferation in vitro and growth performance in PEDV-infected piglets, and inhibited PEDV replication and the expression of several cytokines (including IL-8) both in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic analyses identified that the abundances of 29 proteins in the ileum were altered by PEDV infection and restored to the control level by PR. Pathway analyses revealed that PR restored the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes and selectively upregulated the expression of guanylate-binding proteins. Western blot analyses showed that PR supplementation inhibited the PEDV-induced NF-κB activation.

The umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) is a nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA virus with an unusually long 3′ UTR that is susceptible to NMD. To establish a systemic infection, the PEMV2 long-distance movement protein p26 was previously shown to both stabilize viral RNAs and bind them for transport through the plant’s vascular system. The current study demonstrated that p26 protects both viral and nonviral messenger RNAs from NMD. Although p26 localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleolus, p26 exerts its anti-NMD effects exclusively in the cytoplasm independently of long-distance movement. Using a transcriptome-wide approach in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana, p26 protected a subset of cellular NMD target transcripts, particularly those containing long, structured, GC-rich 3′ UTRs. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the NMD pathway is highly dysfunctional during PEMV2 infection, with 1,820 (48%) of NMD targets increasing in abundance. Widespread changes in the host transcriptome are common during plant RNA virus infections, and these results suggest that, in at least some instances, virus-mediated NMD inhibition may be a major contributing factor.","","False","mBio","NMD|RNA|3′|Pea|2|RNA|UTR|NMD|PEMV2|NMD|NMD|Nicotiana|NMD|GC-rich|3′|RNA-seq|NMD|1,820|48%|NMD|RNA|NMD","cc-by","","PMC7064760","32156817","GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|GPE","PMC_new","2020-03-10","","10.1128/mBio.00204-20",""

Little is understood regarding how specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3’-end of polycistronic gene arrays in Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of transcription start sites, suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription.

Isatis indigotica has been used for the treatment of wounds, viral infections, and inflammation for centuries. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are found in all classes of life ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. To identify AMPs, I. indigotica was explored using a novel, sensitive, and high-throughput Bacillus subtilis screening system. We found that IiR515 and IiR915 exhibited significant antimicrobial activities against a variety of bacterial (Xanthomonas oryzae, Ralstonia solanacearum, Clavibacter michiganensis, and C. fangii) and fungal (Phytophthora capsici and Botrytis cinerea) pathogens. Scanning electron microscope and cytometric analysis revealed the possible mechanism of these peptides, which was to target and disrupt the bacterial cell membrane. This model was also supported by membrane fluidity and electrical potential analyses. Hemolytic activity assays revealed that these peptides may act as a potential source for clinical medicine development. In conclusion, the plant-derived novel AMPs IiR515 and IiR915 are effective biocontrol agents and can be used as raw materials in the drug discovery field.","","False","Biomolecules","centuries|I.|Xanthomonas|Ralstonia|C.|Phytophthora|Botrytis","cc-by","","PMC7023251","31878275","DATE|NORP|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG","PMC_new","2019-12-24","","10.3390/biom10010030",""

To understand the effect of SADS-CoV on host cells, we characterized the apoptotic pathways and elucidated mechanisms underlying the process of apoptotic cell death after SADS-CoV infection. SADS-CoV-infected cells showed evidence of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The use of a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis and reduction in SADS-CoV replication, suggestive of the association of a caspase-dependent pathway. Furthermore, SADS-CoV infection activated the initiators caspase-8 and -9 and upregulated FasL and Bid cleavage, demonstrating a crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. However, the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Cytochrome c (Cyt c) relocalized to the mitochondria and cytoplasm, respectively, after infection by SADS-CoV. Moreover, Vero E6 and IPI-2I cells treated with cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, were completely protected from SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis and viral replication, suggesting the involvement of cyclophilin D (CypD) in these processes. Altogether, our results indicate that caspase-dependent FasL (extrinsic)- and mitochondria (intrinsic)- mediated apoptotic pathways play a central role in SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis that facilitates viral replication.

Here, we systematically investigated the role of trypsin in PDCoV replication including cell entry, cell-to-cell membrane fusion and virus release. Using pseudovirus entry assays, we demonstrated that PDCoV entry is not trypsin dependent. Furthermore, unlike porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), in which trypsin is important for the release of virus from infected cells, PDCoV release was not affected by trypsin. We also demonstrated that trypsin promotes PDCoV replication by enhancing cell-to-cell membrane fusion. Most importantly, our study illustrates two distinct spreading patterns from infected cells to uninfected cells during PDCoV transmission, and the role of trypsin in PDCoV replication in cells with different virus spreading types. Overall, these results clarify that trypsin promotes PDCoV replication by mediating cell-to-cell fusion transmission but is not crucial for viral entry.

Powder dissolution experiments under non-sink conditions showed similar dissolution profiles for the cocrystals and pure NTZ. However, pre-dissolved cellulosic polymer in the phosphate dissolution medium (pH 7.5) modified the dissolution profile of NTZ when starting from the cocrystals, achieving transient drug supersaturation. Subsequent dissolution studies under sink conditions of polymer-based pharmaceutical powder formulations with NTZ-SUC cocrystals gave a significant improvement of the apparent solubility of NTZ when compared with analogous formulations of pure NTZ and the physical mixture of NTZ and SUC. Scanning electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction analysis of samples recovered after the powder dissolution studies showed that the cocrystals undergo fast dissolution, drug supersaturation and precipitation both in the absence and presence of polymer, suggesting that the solubilization enhancement is due to polymer-induced delay of nucleation and crystal growth of the less soluble NTZ form. The study demonstrates that the incorporation of an appropriate excipient in adequate concentration can be a key factor for inducing and maintaining the solubilization of poorly soluble drugs starting from co-crystallized solid forms.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of children hospitalised with LRTIs at a tertiary paediatric hospital in South Africa and to investigate the role and impact of ACT in these children. METHOD: A retrospective folder review of children hospitalised with LRTI between January and June 2015 was conducted, extracting data on demographic characteristics, health condition, ACT interventions and patient outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1208 individual cases (median [IQR] age 7.6 (2.8–19.0) months), in 1440 hospitalisations, were included. The majority of children were hospitalised primarily for the management of bronchiolitis. Comorbidities were present in 52.6% of patients during at least one of their hospitalisations. Airway clearance therapy was administered in 5.9% (n = 85) of admissions, most commonly conventional (manual) ACT. Transient oxyhaemoglobin desaturation was reported in six children, and one child developed lobar collapse an hour post-treatment. No other adverse events were reported. The median (IQR) duration of hospitalisation was 2.3 (1.5–5.0) days, and the overall mortality rate was 0.7%. Children hospitalised for presumed nosocomial infections and pneumonia had the longest length of stay, were more likely to receive ACT and had the highest mortality rate.

The Human Development Index (HDI), density of physicians and nurses, health expenditure, number of arrivals of international tourists were also collected for control. Chi-square test and logistic regression were applied for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 907 cases occurred in 92 countries.

Vaccinations could contribute to the solution, but the high incidence of BRD already at an early age has made it difficult to introduce suitable vaccination programs. Challenge studies have shown promising results in 3–14 day old calves vaccinated with intranasal BRD vaccine, but very few field trials are available to assess the efficacy of the intranasal vaccines in field conditions. We evaluated the effect of one dose of commercial intranasal vaccination on calf mortality, daily gain, and treatment incidence for BRD in one calf rearing unit. In total, 497 calves (mean age 19 days) were included in our study, 247 of which were vaccinated at the time of arrival to the unit and 250 served as negative controls (unvaccinated). Vaccinated and unvaccinated calves were situated in separate compartments until weaning. Daily gain, treatment incidence, and mortality were recorded until the calves were transported to the finishing unit, which averaged 154.5 days from arrival. RESULTS: Average daily gain over the complete study period was 1151.9 g/day (SD 137.9) for the vaccinated calves and 1139.5 g/day (SD 135.9) for the unvaccinated calves.

METHODS: We designed and evaluated an HBV therapeutic vaccine consisting of a novel Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist T7-EA, an Alum adjuvant and a recombinant HBsAg protein. We used RNA-seq, ELISA and hTLR7/8 reporting assays to characterize T7-EA in vitro and real-time PCR to evaluate the tissue-retention characteristics in vivo. To evaluate the adjuvant potential, we administrated T7-EA intraperitoneally in a formulation with an Alum adjuvant and HBsAg in normal and HBV mice, then, we evaluated the HBsAg-specific immune responses by ELISA and Elispot assays. RESULTS: T7-EA acted as an hTLR7-specific agonist and induced a similar gene expression pattern as an unmodified TLR7 ligand when Raw 264.7 cells were exposed to T7-EA; however, T7-EA was more potent than the unmodified TLR7 ligand. In vivo studies showed that T7-EA had tissue-retaining activity with stimulating local cytokine and chemokine expression for up to 7 days. T7-EA could induce Th1-type immune responses, as evidenced by an increased HBsAg-specific IgG2a titer and a T-cell response in normal mice compared to mice received traditional Alum-adjuvant HBV vaccine. Importantly, T7-EA could break immune tolerance and induce persistent HBsAg-specific antibody and T-cell responses in an HBV mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: T7-EA might be a candidate adjuvant in a prophylactic and therapeutic HBV vaccine.","","False","J Transl Med","7|Alum|HBsAg|RNA-seq|ELISA|Alum|HBsAg|HBV|HBsAg|ELISA|Elispot|264.7|up to 7 days|Th1-type|Alum|HBV|HBV|HBV","cc-by","","PMC7055022","32131853","CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE|PRODUCT|PRODUCT|PRODUCT","PMC_new","2020-03-04","","10.1186/s12967-020-02275-2",""

Here we discuss five cellular processes, namely “autophagy”, “programmed cell death”, “immune response”, “cell cycle alteration”, and “lipid metabolic reprogramming”, that considerably guide viral replication after host infection in an orchestrated manner. On viral infection, “autophagy” and “programmed cell death” are two dynamically synchronized cell survival programs; “immune response” is a cell defense program typically suppressed by viruses; “cell cycle alteration” and “lipid metabolic reprogramming” are two altered cell housekeeping programs tunable in both directions. We emphasize on their functionalities in modulating viral replication, strategies viruses have evolved to tune these processes for their benefit, and how these processes orchestrate and govern cell fate upon viral infection. Understanding how viruses hijack host networks has both academic and industrial values in providing insights toward therapeutic strategy design for viral disease control, offering useful information in applications that aim to use viral vectors to improve human health such as gene therapy, and providing guidelines to maximize viral particle yield for improved vaccine production at a reduced cost.","","False","Virulence","five|two|two","cc-by","","PMC7051146","32050846","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","PMC_new","2020-02-12","","10.1080/21505594.2020.1726594",""

J.","Tuning antiviral CD8 T-cell response via proline-altered peptide ligand vaccination","Viral escape from CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses correlates with disease progression and represents a significant challenge for vaccination. Here, we demonstrate that CD8+ T cell recognition of the naturally occurring MHC-I-restricted LCMV-associated immune escape variant Y4F is restored following vaccination with a proline-altered peptide ligand (APL). The APL increases MHC/peptide (pMHC) complex stability, rigidifies the peptide and facilitates T cell receptor (TCR) recognition through reduced entropy costs. Structural analyses of pMHC complexes before and after TCR binding, combined with biophysical analyses, revealed that although the TCR binds similarly to all complexes, the p3P modification alters the conformations of a very limited amount of specific MHC and peptide residues, facilitating efficient TCR recognition. This approach can be easily introduced in peptides restricted to other MHC alleles, and can be combined with currently available and future vaccination protocols in order to prevent viral immune escape. Author SummaryViral escape mutagenesis correlates often with disease progression and represents a major hurdle for vaccination-based therapies. Here, we have designed and developed a novel generation of altered epitopes that re-establish and enhance significantly CD8+ T cell recognition of a naturally occurring viral immune escape variant. Biophysical and structural analyses provide a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this reestablished recognition. We believe that this approach can be implemented to currently available or novel vaccination approaches to efficiently restore T cell recognition of virus escape variants to control disease progression.","96ef1767754a53f792951ba1752440ae94e90c60","True","","MHC|Y4F|APL|APL|MHC|TCR|TCR|TCR|p3P|MHC|TCR|MHC|Biophysical","biorxiv","","","","ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2019-12-02","","10.1101/862144","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This plant pathogen has a broad host range estimated to 560 plant species. Five subspecies of the pathogen with different but overlapping host ranges have been described, but only three subspecies are widely accepted, namely subspecies fastidiosa, multiplex and pauca. Initially limited to the Americas, Xf has been detected in Europe since 2013. As management of X. fastidiosa outbreaks in Europe depends on the identification of the subspecies, accurate determination of the subspecies in infected plants as early as possible is of major interest. Thus, we developed various tetraplex and triplex qPCR assays for Xylella fastidiosa detection and subspecies identification in planta in a single reaction. We designed primers and probes using SkIf, a bioinformatics tool based on k-mers, to detect specific signatures of the species and subspecies from a dataset of 58 genome sequences representative of X. fastidiosa diversity. We tested the qPCR assays on 39 target and 30 non-target strains, as well as on 13 different plant species spiked with strains of the different subspecies of X. fastidiosa, and on samples from various environmental and inoculated host plants. Sensitivity of simplex assays was equal or slightly better than the reference protocol on purified DNA. Tetraplex qPCR assays had the same sensitivity than the reference protocol and allowed X. fastidiosa detection in all spiked matrices up to 103 cells.mL-1. Moreover, mix infections of two to three subspecies could be detected in the same sample with tetraplex assays. In environmental plant samples, the tetraplex qPCR assays allowed subspecies identification when the current method based on multilocus sequence typing failed. The qPCR assays described here are robust and modular tools that are efficient for differentiating X. fastidiosa subspecies directly in plant samples.","feb8807e8418fdd6c4b8816ea761c9a68767a407","True","","Xylella|560|Five|only three|Americas|Xf|Europe|2013|X.|Europe|Xylella|SkIf|58|X.|39|30|13|X.|Tetraplex|X.|103|two to three|X.","biorxiv","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|LOC|GPE|LOC|DATE|ORG|LOC|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","biorxiv","2019-12-03","","10.1101/699371","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Rodent models for BE of palatable food permit the study of genetic and biological mechanisms. We previously used genetic mapping and transcriptome analysis to map a coding mutation in Cyfip2 associated with increased BE in the BE-prone C57BL/6NJ substrain compared to the BE-resistant C57BL/6J substrain. The increase in BE in C57BL/6NJ mice was associated with a decrease in transcription of genes enriched for myelination in the striatum. Here, we tested the hypothesis that decreasing myelin levels with the demyelinating agent cuprizone would enhance BE. Mice were treated with a 0.3% cuprizone home cage diet for two weeks. Following a three-week recovery period, mice were trained for BE in an intermittent, limited access procedure. Cuprizone induced similar weight loss in both substrains and sexes that recovered within 48 h after removal of the cuprizone diet. Surprisingly, cuprizone reduced BE in male but not female C57BL/6NJ mice while having no effect in C57BL/6J mice. Cuprizone also reduced myelin basic protein (MBP) at seven weeks post-cuprizone removal while having no effect on myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) at this time point. C57BL/6N mice also showed less MBP than C57BL/6J mice. There were no statistical interactions of Treatment with Sex on MBP levels, indicating that differences in MBP are unlikely to account for sex differences in BE. To summarize, cuprizone induced an unexpected, male-specific reduction in BE which could indicate sex-specific biological mechanisms that depend on genetic background.","a4d1861ceb0adf8dbdb8aed9465a3487fded5568","True","","Cyfip2|BE|C57BL/6NJ|C57BL/6J|BE|C57BL/6NJ|0.3%|two weeks|three-week|48|C57BL/6NJ|C57BL/6J|Cuprizone|MBP|seven weeks|MAG|C57BL/6N|MBP|C57BL/6J|MBP|MBP|BE|BE","biorxiv","","","","ORG|FAC|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|DATE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|GPE|FAC","biorxiv","2019-12-05","","10.1101/865600","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Then we looked for evidence of ecological divergence among ecotypes based on differences in host bird associations within the Connecticut-New York region. Our results indicated significant heterogeneity among ecotypes for their associations with different bird hosts.

By combining Illumina short-read and nanopore long-read direct RNA sequencing approaches, we mapped transcription start sites and cleavage and polyadenylation sites across the adenovirus genome. The canonical viral early and late RNA cassettes were confirmed, but analysis of splice junctions within long RNA reads revealed an additional 20 novel viral transcripts. These RNAs include seven new splice junctions which lead to expression of canonical open reading frames (ORF), as well as 13 transcripts encoding for messages that potentially alter protein functions through truncations or the fusion of canonical ORFs.

"Qiu, X.; Bahl, J.","Structurally informed evolutionary models improve phylogenetic reconstruction for emerging, seasonal, and pandemic influenza viruses","Precise estimation of genetic substitution patterns is critical for accurate reconstruction of pathogen phylogenies. Few studies of viral evolution account for variations of mutation rate across a single gene. This is especially true when considering evolution of segmented viruses where individual segments are short, encoding for few proteins. However, the structural and functional partitions of these proteins could provide valuable information for more accurate inference of viral evolution, due to the disparate immune selection pressure on different functional domains. Accurately reconstructed evolutionary features on specific functional domains can in turn provide biological information on viral protein and immune targets for vaccine design. In this study we developed and evaluated a structurally informed partitioning scheme that accounts for rate variation among immunogenic head and stalk domains of the surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza viruses. We evaluated the model fit and performance of four different models - HKY, SRD06 codon, HKY with a structurally informed partitioning scheme, SRD06 with a structurally informed partitioning scheme on pandemic A/H1N1pdm09, seasonal A/H1N1postpdm, A/H3N2, B-Yamagata-like and Victoria-like lineages, and two highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses H5Nx and H7N9. Results showed that structurally informed partitioning with SRD06 performed better for all datasets with decisively statistical support. Significantly faster nucleotide substitution rates for head domain, compared to stalk domain was observed and may provide insight for stalk derived broadly-reactive vaccine design. Taken together, integrating a functionally informed partitioning scheme based on protein structures of immune targets allows for significant improvement of phylogenetic analysis and providing important biological insights.","75216c0238ddc17dec8ef66adcc84bd48922cae4","True","","Accurately|four|SRD06|HKY|SRD06|A/H1N1pdm09|seasonal|Victoria-like|two|H5Nx|H7N9","biorxiv","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON","biorxiv","2019-12-13","","10.1101/228692","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Many of these molecules comprise regions with varying structural properties including disorder, flexibility, and partial occupancy. These traits make computational 3D reconstruction from 2D images challenging. Detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs, used to keep membrane proteins in solution, are common examples of locally disordered structures that can negatively affect existing iterative refinement algorithms which assume rigidity (or spatial uniformity). We introduce a cross-validation approach to derive non-uniform refinement, an algorithm that automatically regularizes 3D density maps during iterative refinement to account for spatial variability, yielding dramatically improved resolution and 3D map quality. We find that in common iterative refinement methods, regularization using spatially uniform filtering operations can simultaneously over- and under-regularize local regions of a 3D map. In contrast, non-uniform refinement removes noise in disordered regions while retaining signal useful for aligning particle images. Our results include state-of-the-art resolution 3D reconstructions of multiple membrane proteins with molecular weight as low as 90kDa. These results demonstrate that higher resolutions and improved 3D density map quality can be achieved even for small membrane proteins, an important use case for single particle cryo-EM, both in structural biology and drug discovery.

Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly larger vacuoles for virus-infected M. restricta cells, indicating that MrV40 infection dramatically altered M. restricta physiology. Our analysis also revealed that a viral nucleic acid from MrV40 induces a TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and this result suggests that a viral element contributes to the pathogenesis of Malassezia.

Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases, causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. A critical step in the life cycle of MERS-CoV is the fusion with the host cell with its spike (S) protein as main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by substituting E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP with neutrally charged alanines. Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudo-particles (PPs) on host cells without and with Ca2+. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+ interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds two. Our data suggests that there are significant differences in FP-Ca2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of Ca2+ ions interacting with the FP has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus.","73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6","True","","Middle East|first|2012|2,468|851|FP|CoV|FP|CoV|CoV|FP|CoV|FP|approximately two|FP|CoV|FP|CoV|FP|two|FP|CoV|FP|FP","biorxiv","","","","LOC|ORDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2019-12-19","","10.1101/2019.12.18.881391","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Bjornstad, O. N.; Grenfell, B.; Viboud, C.; King, A.","Comparison of alternative models of human movement and the spread of disease","Predictive models for the spatial spread of infectious diseases has received much attention in recent years as tools for the management of infectious diseas outbreaks. Prominently, various versions of the so-called gravity model, borrowed from transportation theory, have been used. However, the original literature suggests that the model has some potential misspecifications inasmuch as it fails to capture higher-order interactions among population centers. The fields of economics, geography and network sciences holds alternative formulations for the spatial coupling within and among conurbations. These includes Stouffers rank model, Fotheringhams competing destinations model and the radiation model of Simini et al. Since the spread of infectious disease reflects mobility through the filter of age-specific susceptibility and infectivity and since, moreover, disease may alter spatial behavior, it is essential to confront with epidemiological data on spread. To study their relative merit we, accordingly, fit variants of these models to the uniquely detailed dataset of prevaccination measles in the 954 cities and towns of England and Wales over the years 1944-65 and compare them using a consistent likelihood framework. We find that while the gravity model is a reasonable first approximation, both Stouffers rank model, an extended version of the radiation model and the Fotheringham competing destinations model provide significantly better fits, Stouffers model being the best. Through a new method of spatially disaggregated likelihoods we identify areas of relatively poorer fit, and show that it is indeed in densely-populated conurbations that higher order spatial interactions are most important. Our main conclusion is that it is premature to narrow in on a single class of models for predicting spatial spread of infectious disease. The supplemental materials contain all code for reproducing the results and applying the methods to other data sets. Author summaryThe ability to predict how infectious disease will spread is of great importance in the face of the numerous emergent and re-emergent pathogens that currently threatening human well-being. We identified a variety of alternative models that predict human mobility as as a function of population distribution across a landscape. These consider some models that account for pair-wise interactions between population centers, as well as some that allow for higher-order interactions. We trained the models using a uniquely rich spatiotemporal data set on pre-vaccination measles in England and wales (1944-65), which comprises more than a million records from 954 cities and towns. Likelihood rankings of the different models reveal strong evidence for higher-order interactions in the form of competition among cities as destinations for travelers and, thus, dilution of spatial transmission.

Currently, a combination of several specialised short-read sequencing approaches and additional biochemical experiments are required to describe all transcriptomic features. In this study, we present native RNA sequencing of bacterial (E. coli) and archaeal (H. volcanii, P. furiosus) transcriptomes employing the Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology. Based on this approach, we could address multiple transcriptomic characteristics simultaneously with single-molecule resolution. Taking advantage of long RNA reads provided by the Nanopore platform, we could accurately (re-)annotate large transcriptional units and boundaries. Our analysis of transcription termination sites revealed that diverse termination mechanisms are in place in archaea. Moreover, we shed light on the poorly understood rRNA processing pathway in archaea and detected new processing intermediates. One of the key features of native RNA sequencing is that RNA modifications are retained. We could confirm this ability by analysing the well-known KsgA-dependent rRNA methylation sites. Notably, our analysis suggests that rRNA modifications are more abundant in a hyperthermophilic organism.","8c223fd63ba6a924ecd3df8d32bcf0556758cb95","True","","RNA|RNA|H.|the Oxford Nanopore|RNA|Nanopore|One|RNA|RNA|KsgA","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON","biorxiv","2019-12-19","","10.1101/2019.12.18.880849","biorxiv_medrxiv"

E.; Zimmermann, A.; Arango Duque, G.; Descoteaux, A.; Alain, T.; Larsson, O.; Jaramillo, M.","Translational profiling of macrophages infected with Leishmania donovani identifies mTOR- and eIF4A-sensitive immune-related transcripts","The protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) causes visceral leishmaniasis, a chronic infection which is fatal when untreated. While previous studies showed that L. donovani reprograms transcription to subvert host cell functions, it remains unclear whether the parasite also alters host mRNA translation to establish a successful infection. To assess this, we compared transcriptome-wide translation in primary mouse macrophages infected with L. donovani promastigotes or amastigotes using polysome-profiling. This identified ample selective changes in translation (3,127 transcripts) which were predicted to target central cellular functions by inducing synthesis of proteins related to chromatin remodeling and RNA metabolism while inhibiting those related to intracellular trafficking and antigen presentation. Parallel quantification of protein and mRNA levels for a set of transcripts whose translation was activated upon L. donovani infection (Papbpc1, Eif2ak2, and Tgfb) confirmed, as indicated by polysome-profiling, increased protein levels despite largely unaltered mRNA levels. Mechanistic in silico analyses suggested activated translation depending on the kinase mTOR (e.g. Pabpc1) and the RNA helicase eIF4A (e.g. Tgfb) during infection. Accordingly, treatment with mTOR inhibitors torin-1 or rapamycin reversed L. donovani-induced PABPC1 without affecting corresponding transcript levels. Similarly, the production of TGF-{beta} decreased in presence of the eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol despite unaltered Tgfb mRNA levels. Consistent with parasite modulation of host eIF4A-sensitive translation to promote infection, silvestrol suppressed L. donovani replication within macrophages. In contrast, parasite survival was favored under mTOR inhibition. In summary, infection-associated changes in translation of mTOR- and eIF4A-sensitive mRNAs contribute to modulate mRNA metabolism and immune responses in L. donovani-infected macrophages. Although the net outcome of such translation programs favours parasite propagation, individual translation programs appear to have opposing roles during L. donovani infection, thereby suggesting their selective targeting as key for therapeutic effects. Author SummaryFine-tuning the efficiency of mRNA translation into proteins allows cells to tailor their responses to stress without the need for synthesizing new mRNA molecules. It is well established that the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani alters transcription of specific genes to subvert host cell functions. However, discrepancies between transcriptomic and proteomic data suggest that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms also contribute to modulate host gene expression programs during L. donovani infection. Herein, we report that one third of protein-coding mRNAs expressed in macrophages are differentially translated upon infection with L. donovani. Our computational analyses reveal that subsets of mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins share the same directionality of translational regulation, which is likely to impact metabolic and microbicidal activity of infected cells. We also show that upregulated translation of transcripts that encode central regulators of mRNA metabolism and inflammation is sensitive to the activation of mTOR or eIF4A during infection. Finally, we observe that inhibition of eIF4A activity reduces parasite survival within macrophages while selective blockade of mTOR has the opposite effect. Thus, our study points to a dual role for translational control of host gene expression during L. donovani infection and suggests that novel regulatory nodes could be targeted for therapeutic intervention.","d83e3c028de1950c4f8dedae21eb90f90c4ed6c3","True","","Leishmania|L.|L.|L.|3,127|RNA|L.|Papbpc1|Mechanistic|Pabpc1|RNA|eIF4A|L. donovani|PABPC1|eIF4A|Tgfb|eIF4A|L.|eIF4A|mRNAs|L. donovani|L.|SummaryFine|Leishmania|L.|Herein|one third|mRNAs|L.|eIF4A|eIF4A|L.","biorxiv","","","","GPE|NORP|NORP|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|ORG|DATE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|NORP|ORG|GPE|NORP|PERSON|QUANTITY|PERSON|NORP|ORG|ORG|NORP","biorxiv","2019-12-20","","10.1101/2019.12.20.884338","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However, in animal models, especially cats (a common model of spinal cord injury and associated bladder pathology), anesthesia is often required for these procedures and can be a research confounder. This study compared the effects of select agents (dexmedetomidine, alfaxalone, propofol, isoflurane, and -chloralose) on urodynamic ({Delta}pressure, bladder capacity, bladder compliance, non-voiding contractions, bladder pressure slopes) and anesthetic (change in heart rate [{Delta}HR], average heart rate [HR], reflexes, induction/recovery times) parameters in repeated cystometrograms across five adult male cats. {Delta}pressure was greatest with propofol, bladder capacity was highest with -chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with -chloralose. Propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively. Cats progressed to a deeper plane of anesthesia (lower HR, smaller {Delta}HR, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared to propofol and alfaxalone. Time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery was shortest with dexmedetomidine. These agent-specific differences in urodynamic and anesthetic parameters in cats will facilitate appropriate study-specific anesthetic choices.","cb346b64e20934bc01f7727cf51494b22f172de0","True","","five|Propofol","biorxiv","","","","CARDINAL|ORG","biorxiv","2019-12-23","","10.1101/868398","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because, in contrast to the "classic" flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein(s) and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMTV group, from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the JMTV group. Significance StatementWe isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV) from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks from two geographically separate areas of Russia in the Ixodes ricinus tick cell line IRE/CTVM19.

Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. The majority of virions of the ALSV strain Miass527 were enveloped spherical particles with a diameter of 40.5{+/-}3.7 nm.

N.","Interleukin-33 promotes type 1 cytokine expression via p38 MAPK in human natural killer cells","This study tests the hypothesis that activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by physiologically-relevant concentrations of interleukin-33 (IL-33) contributes to enhanced cytokine expression by IL-12 stimulated human natural killer (NK) cells. While IL-33 canonically triggers type 2 cytokine responses, this cytokine can also synergize with type 1 cytokines like IL-12 to provoke interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}). We show that picogram concentrations of IL-12 and IL-33 are sufficient to promote robust secretion of IFN-{gamma} by human NK cells that greatly exceeds responses to either cytokine alone. Nanogram doses of IL-33, potentially consistent with levels in tissue microenvironments, synergize with IL-12 to induce secretion of additional cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). IL-33-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in human NK cells is crucial for enhanced release of IFN-{gamma} and TNF in response to IL-12. Mechanistically, IL-33-induced p38 MAPK signaling enhances stability of IFNG transcripts and triggers ADAM17-mediated cleavage of TNF from the cell surface. These data support our hypothesis and suggest that altered sensitivity of NK cells to IL-12 in the presence of IL-33 may have important consequences in diseases associated with mixed cytokine milieus, like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

We confirm that the expression level of IFITM3 plays a role in determining the level of viral infection through manipulation of IFITM3 levels with interferon (IFN) stimulation and overexpression systems. Low basal expression may put some immune cells, including lymphocytes and lung-resident macrophages, at risk of influenza virus infection. Investigating the induction of IFITM3 by IFN, we find a strong preference for Type I IFN in IFITM3 induction in both cell lines and primary human cells. While myeloid cells can increase expression following stimulation by Type I IFN, lymphocytes show minimal induction of IFITM3 following IFN stimulation, suggesting that they are always at risk of viral infection. Surprisingly, we found that the time it takes for maximal induction of IFITM3 is relatively slow for an interferon-stimulated gene at around 36 hours. Low basal expression and slow induction of IFITM3 could increase the risk of influenza virus infection in selected immune cells. ImportanceInfluenza virus infection remains one of the top ten threats to global health, causing significant deaths and hospitalisations across the world each year. Understanding mechanisms for controlling influenza virus infection remain a priority. The interferon-induced transmembrane protein IFITM3 can restrict influenza infection by limiting replication of the virus. The precise mechanisms of how IFITM3 reduced replication of influenza are unknown, although it is predicted to prevent release of viral contents into the cytosol by preventing pore formation on the endosomal compartments where it is suggested to reside. Here we have shown that the expression level of IFITM3 is important in determining the control of influenza virus infection. We find an expression pattern for IFITM3 that varies based on cell type, tissue locality, differentiation state and cell naivety, all of which highlights cells that may be at the highest risk of influenza infection.","48df5b06710467cbe5b41dd851e946fc936ecf15","True","","IFITM3|ten years|IFITM3|IFITM3|IFN|IFITM3|IFN|IFITM3|IFITM3|around 36 hours|IFITM3|ImportanceInfluenza|one|ten|IFITM3|IFITM3|IFITM3|IFITM3","biorxiv","","","","ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|TIME|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2019-12-23","","10.1101/2019.12.20.885590","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV. Author SummaryInfectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets.","09c9fcabc66a106e01ef42247cbd86b6d85bd67f","True","","ARTDs|RNA|Chikungunya|CHIKV|ADP|MARylation|four|MARylation|CHIKV|MARylation|ARTD12|CHIKV|four|nsPs|nsPs|MAR|CHIKV|nsPs|MARylation|ARTD10|MAR|MAR|CHIKV|Chikungunya|CHIKV|CHIKV|CHIKV","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2020-01-08","","10.1101/2020.01.07.896977","biorxiv_medrxiv"

PAR-2 is normally expressed basolaterally in differentiated nasal ciliated cells. ObjectiveWe tested if epithelial remodeling during diseases characterized by loss of cilia and squamous metaplasia may alter PAR-2 polarization. MethodsEndogenous PAR-2 responses were measured by live cell calcium and cilia imaging, measurement of fluid secretion, and quantification of cytokines. We utilized airway squamous cell lines, primary differentiated air-liquid interface cultures, and tissue explants. Cells were exposed to disease-related modifiers that alter epithelial morphology, including IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, and retinoic acid deficiency. We used concentrations and exposure times that altered epithelial morphology without causing breakdown of the epithelial barrier, likely reflecting early disease states. ResultsPAR-2 signaling in airway squamous cells activated calcium and inflammatory responses. Squamous cells cultured at air liquid interface (ALI) responded to PAR-2 agonists applied both apically and basolaterally. Primary well-differentiated nasal epithelial ALI cultures responded only to basolateral PAR-2 stimulation. Primary cultures exposed to IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, or reduced retinoic acid responded to both apical and basolateral PAR-2 stimulation. Nasal polyp tissue, but not control middle turbinate, exhibited apical calcium responses to PAR-2 stimulation. However, isolated ciliated cells from both polyp and turbinate maintained basolateral PAR-2 polarization. ConclusionsSquamous metaplasia and/or loss of cilia enhances apical PAR-2 responses.

P.","Cotranslational Folding Stimulates Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting in the Alphavirus Structural Polyprotein","Viruses maximize their genetic coding capacity through a variety of biochemical mechanisms including programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), which facilitates the production of multiple proteins from a single transcript. PRF is typically stimulated by structural elements within the mRNA that generate mechanical tension between the transcript and ribosome. However, in this work we show that the forces generated by the cotranslational folding of the nascent polypeptide chain can also enhance PRF. Using an array of biochemical, cellular, and computational techniques, we first demonstrate that the Sindbis virus structural polyprotein forms two competing topological isomers during biosynthesis at the ribosome-translocon complex. We then show that the formation of one of these topological isomers is linked to PRF. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the translocon-mediated membrane integration of a transmembrane domain upstream from the ribosomal slip-site generates a force on the nascent polypeptide chain that scales with observed frameshifting. Together, our results demonstrate that cotranslational folding of this protein generates a tension that stimulates PRF. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first example in which the conformational state of the nascent chain has been linked to PRF. These findings raise the possibility that, in addition to RNA-mediated translational recoding, a variety of cotranslational folding and/ or binding events may also stimulate PRF.","7837a1b529936ac78b802e41daa73ddab8bfc41a","True","","first|Sindbis|two|one|first|RNA","biorxiv","","","","ORDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG","biorxiv","2020-01-16","","10.1101/790444","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Yuan, H.; Ma, L.; Zhang, L.; Li, X.; Xia, C.","Crystal structure of the giant panda MHC class I complex: first insights into the viral peptide presentation profile in the bear family","The viral cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope peptides presented by classical MHC-I molecules require the assembly of a peptide-MHC-I-{beta}2m (aka pMHC-I) trimolecular complex for TCR recognition, which is the critical activation link for triggering antiviral T cell immunity. Ursidae includes 5 genera and 8 species; however, research on T cell immunology in this family, especially structural immunology, is lacking. In this study, the structure of the key trimolecular complex pMHC-1 (aka pAime-128), which binds a peptide from canine distemper virus, was solved for the first time using giant panda as a representative species of Ursidae. The structural characteristics of the giant panda pMHC-I complex, including the unique pockets in the peptide-binding groove (PBG), were analyzed in detail. Comparing the panda pMHC-I to others in the bear family and extending the comparison to other mammals revealed distinct features. The interaction between MHC-I and {beta}2m, the features of pAime-128 involved in TCR docking and CD8 binding, the anchor sites in the PBG, and the CTL epitopes of potential viruses that infect pandas were concretely clarified. Unique features of pMHC-I viral antigen presentation in the panda were revealed by solving the three-dimensional structure of pAime-128. The distinct characteristics of pAime-128 indicate an unusual event that emerged during the evolution of the MHC system in the bear family. These results provide a new platform for research on panda CTL immunity and the design of vaccines for application in the bear family. IMPORTANCEUrsidae includes 5 genera and 8 species; however, the study of its immunology, especially structural immunology, is extremely rare to date. In this paper, we first crystallized the key complex pMHC-I, taking the giant panda as its representative species. Structural characteristics of the giant panda pMHC-I complexes, contains the unique pockets of PBG were analyzed in detail. Comparison of the panda pMHC-I in the bear family and other mammals, almost definite features was displayed. Meanwhile, the interaction between HC and LV, the unique features of pMHC-I in the CD8 binding and TCR docking, validation of anchor site in the PBG, and epitopes of potential viruses infected with the pandas, were concretely clarified. These unique characteristics of pMHC-I clearly indicate an unusual situation during the evolution of MHC molecules in the endangered pandas. These results also provide a novel platform for further study of panda T cell immunology and vaccines.","de3ae7971891058db2f4b36cd216531e6f533332","True","","CTL|MHC|TCR|Ursidae|5|8|first|Ursidae|PBG|MHC|TCR|CD8|PBG|CTL|Unique|three|MHC|CTL|IMPORTANCEUrsidae|5|8|first|PBG|Comparison|HC|LV|CD8|TCR|PBG|MHC","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG|PERSON|GPE|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2020-01-16","","10.1101/2020.01.15.908608","biorxiv_medrxiv"

To address these challenges, we develop a platform for low-cost and rapid detection of viral RNA with DNA nanoswitches designed to mechanically reconfigure in response to specific viruses. Using Zika virus as a model system, we show non-enzymatic detection of viral RNA to the attomole level, with selective and multiplexed detection between related viruses and viral strains. For clinical-level sensitivity in biological fluids, we paired the assay with a sample preparation step using either RNA extraction or isothermal pre-amplification. Our assay can be performed with minimal or no lab infrastructure, and is readily adaptable (with [~]24-hour development time) to detect other viruses. Given this versatility, we expect that further development and field implementation will improve our ability to detect emergent viral threats and ultimately limit their impact.","f8e8a9c6f5662c1739be031e6134284ef08ea8b2","True","","Zika|RNA|Zika|RNA|RNA","biorxiv","","","","GPE|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2020-01-16","","10.1101/2020.01.12.902452","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The mechanisms that lead to mortality in these children are poorly understood. Studies of the cellular immunology of the infant airway have traditionally been hindered by the limited sample volumes available from the young, frail children who are admitted to hospital with pneumonia. This is further compounded by the relatively low frequencies of certain immune cell phenotypes that are thought to be critical to the clinical outcome of pneumonia. To address this, we developed a novel in-silico deconvolution method for inferring the frequencies of immune cell phenotypes in the airway of children with different survival outcomes using proteomic data. MethodsUsing high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified > 1,000 proteins expressed in the airways of children who were admitted to hospital with clinical pneumonia. 61 of these children were discharged from hospital and survived for more than 365 days after discharge, while 19 died during admission. We used machine learning by random forest to derive protein features that could be used to deconvolve immune cell phenotypes in paediatric airway samples. We applied these phenotype-specific signatures to identify airway-resident immune cell phenotypes that were differentially enriched by survival status and validated the findings using a large retrospective pneumonia cohort. Main ResultsWe identified immune-cell phenotype classification features for 33 immune cell types. Eosinophil-associated features were significantly elevated in airway samples obtained from pneumonia survivors and were downregulated in children who subsequently died. To confirm these results, we analyzed clinical parameters from >10,000 children who had been admitted with pneumonia in the previous 10 years. The results of this retrospective analysis mirrored airway deconvolution data and showed that survivors had significantly elevated eosinophils at admission compared to fatal pneumonia. ConclusionsUsing a proteomics bioinformatics approach, we identify airway eosinophils as a critical factor for pneumonia survival in infants and young children.","9a3de625119a83aa1401eeb297937d9605f0d1f1","True","","RationalePneumonia|1,000|61|more than 365 days|19|Main ResultsWe|33|Eosinophil|10,000|the previous 10 years","biorxiv","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE","biorxiv","2020-01-19","","10.1101/840090","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor.

C.","Novel ionophores active against La Crosse virus identified through rapid antiviral screening","Bunyaviruses are significant human pathogens, causing diseases ranging from hemorrhagic fevers to encephalitis. Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication. ImportanceNo antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis. We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising in vitro antiviral activity. We demonstrate that valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses. We finally observe that valinomycin has activity against a wide array of human viral pathogens, suggesting that disrupting potassium ion homeostasis with valinomycin may be a potent host pathway to target to quell virus infection.","403d885a33958731c4607ea632453e25a89e2b57","True","","La Crosse|California|United States|dozens|yearly|Valinomycin|Valinomycin|Rift Valley|Keystone|Coxsackievirus|Zika|229E|CoV|ImportanceNo|hundreds|La Crosse|La Crosse","biorxiv","","","","PERSON|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|NORP|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON","biorxiv","2020-01-23","","10.1101/2020.01.21.914929","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Here, empirical guidelines for siRNA design and comprehensive target site availability analysis were used to select effective siRNA from a plethora of potential candidates designed using several computation algorithms. Then, the selected siRNA candidates were subjected to stringent similarity searches in order to obtain siRNA candidates with reduced off-target effects (high specificity). The best candidates were compared to experimentally successful gremlin-1 siRNAs in order to predict the silencing potency of the selected siRNAs. siRNA-6 (sense strand: 5-CCAAGAAAUUCACUACCAU-3), siRNA-7 (sense strand: 5-CCAUGAUGGUCACACUCAA-3) and siRNA-47 (sense strand: 5-GGCCCAGCACAAUGACUCA-3) were predicted to be highly effective siRNA candidates for gremlin-1 silencing.

Fortunately, there has not yet been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.005. This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a large global epidemic.","b6e92eda6c26b456165422d4e5552b81754c4a82","True","","Wuhan|China|830|26|24 January 2020|2019-nCoV|China|South Korea|Thailand|Japan|USA|China|47|China|2019-nCoV|0.37|only 0.005","biorxiv","","","","GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-01-25","","10.1101/2020.01.24.919159","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Unexpectedly, we discovered that dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV4) was circulating in these mosquito populations, representing the first documented case of such a phenomenon in the absence of a local DENV4 human case in this county over a two-year period. We confirmed that all of the mosquito populations carried the same DENV4 strain, assembled its full genome, validated infection orthogonally by reverse transcriptase PCR, traced the virus origin, estimated the time period of its introduction to the Caribbean region, as well as explored the viral genetic signatures and mosquito-specific virome associations that potentially mediated DENV4 persistence in mosquitoes. We discuss the significance of prolonged maintenance of these DENV4 infections in Ae. aegypti that occurred in the absence of a DENV4 human index case in Manatee County with respect to the inability of current surveillance paradigms to detect mosquito vector infections prior to a potential local outbreak. ImportanceSince 1999, dengue outbreaks in the continental United States (U.S.) involving local transmission have occurred episodically and only in Florida and Texas. In Florida, these episodes appear to be coincident with increased introductions of dengue virus into the region through human travel and migration from endemic countries. To date, the U.S. public health response to dengue outbreaks is largely reactive, and implementation of comprehensive arbovirus surveillance in advance of predictable transmission seasons, which would enable proactive preventative efforts, remains unsupported. The significance of our finding is that it is the first documented report of non-outbreak DENV4 transmission and maintenance within a local mosquito vector population in the continental U.S.in the absence of a human case during a two-year time period. Our data suggest that molecular surveillance of mosquito populations in high-risk, high tourism areas of the U.S., may allow for proactive, targeted vector control before potential arbovirus outbreaks.","e29b287d326be9c2c0a7dcd7a81cb49cc2125360","True","","the last decade|the United States|Aedes|four|Ae|2016-2017|Manatee County|Florida|4|DENV4|first|DENV4|two-year|DENV4|Caribbean|DENV4|DENV4|Ae|DENV4|Manatee County|ImportanceSince 1999|United States|U.S.|Florida|Texas|Florida|U.S.|first|DENV4|two-year|U.S.","biorxiv","","","","DATE|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|LOC|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORDINAL|ORG|DATE|GPE","biorxiv","2020-01-25","","10.1101/2020.01.24.919282","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. This study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-nCov infection disease, and could be informative for future anti-ACE2 therapeutic strategy development.","68e509d42a7d3349550512d80eca4e2b2123613f","True","","2019-nCov|Wuhan|Hubei Province|China|December of 2019|thousands|China|2019-nCov|Angiotensin|enzyme 2|RNA-Seq|RNA|between eight|Asian|2019-nCov","biorxiv","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-01-26","","10.1101/2020.01.26.919985","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. MethodsPutative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. ResultsOur analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. ConclusionsThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.","","False","","2019-nCoV|Wuhan|China|2019-nCoV|MethodsPutative|Bayesian|2019-nCoV|BatCoV|96.3%|Bat-SARS|first|11,498|24,341|2019-nCoV|RaTG13|Bat|3-end|ORF1b|almost half|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|RaTG13|2019-nCoV|2019-nCov|almost half","biorxiv","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|PERSON|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-01-27","","10.1101/2020.01.26.920249","biorxiv_medrxiv"

F.","Chronic hM3Dq signaling in microglia ameliorates neuroinflammation in male mice","Microglia express muscarinic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that sense cholinergic activity and are activated by acetylcholine to potentially regulate microglial functions. Knowledge about how distinct types of muscarinic GPCR signaling regulate microglia function in vitro and in vivo is still poor, partly due to the fact that some of these receptors are also present in astrocytes and neurons. We generated mice expressing the hM3Dq Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) selectively in microglia to investigate the role of muscarinic M3Gq-linked signaling. We show that activation of hM3Dq using clozapine N-oxide (CNO) elevated intracellular calcium levels and increased phagocytosis of FluoSpheres in vitro. Acute treatment with CNO in vivo did not affect male mouse behavior, however chronic CNO treatment decreased sickness behavior triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Interestingly, whereas acute treatment with CNO increased synthesis of cytokine mRNA, chronic treatment attenuated LPS-induced cytokine mRNA changes in the brain, likely explaining the improvement in sickness behavior by chronic hM3Dq activation. No effect of CNO was observed in DREADD-negative mice. These results suggest that chronic activation of M3 muscarinic receptors (the hM3Dq progenitor) in microglia, and potentially other Gq-coupled GPCRs, preconditions microglia to decrease their response to further immunological challenges. Our results indicate that hM3Dq can be a useful tool to modulate neuroinflammation and study microglial immunological memory in vivo, which may be applicable for manipulations of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.

Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.","","False","","2019|2019-nCoV|more than 800|25|RBD|2019-nCoV|CoV|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV.|first|CoV|CR3022|2019-nCoV|RBD|KD|6.3 nM|CR3022|2019-nCoV|RBD|CR3022|2019-nCoV|CoV|CR3014|CoV|2019-nCoV|RBD|CoV|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|RBD","biorxiv","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|PERSON|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|MONEY|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|PRODUCT|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","biorxiv","2020-01-28","","10.1101/2020.01.28.923011","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. MethodsAccounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate ({gamma}), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. FindingsThe early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0. ConclusionThe mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and significantly larger than 1.

MethodsWe downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs. ResultsAn isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs.

By using a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) and a defined P2 library containing a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids, we established a full substrate specificity profile for two DUBs--MERS PLpro and human UCH-L3. Based on these results, we designed and synthesized Ub-based substrates and activity-based probes (ABPs) containing selected unnatural amino acids located in the C-terminal Ub motif. Biochemical analysis and cell-based experiments confirmed the activity and selectivity of engineered Ub-based substrates and probes. Using this approach, we propose that for any protease that recognizes Ub and Ub-like substrates, a highly active and selective unnatural substrate or probe can be engineered.","","False","","Ub|Ub|Ub|Z-LRGG-AMC|Ub-AMC|HyCoSuL|two|PLpro|UCH|Ub|Ub|Ub|Ub|Ub","biorxiv","","","","PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|WORK_OF_ART|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|PERSON","biorxiv","2020-01-31","","10.1101/2020.01.30.926881","biorxiv_medrxiv"

"Mock, F.; Viehweger, A.; Barth, E.; Marz, M.","VIDHOP, viral host prediction with Deep Learning","MotivationZoonosis, the natural transmission of infections from animals to humans, is a far-reaching global problem. The recent outbreaks of Zika virus, Ebola virus and Corona virus are examples of viral zoonosis, which occur more frequently due to globalization. In the case of a virus outbreak, it is helpful to know which host organism was the original carrier of the virus. Once the reservoir or intermediate host is known, it can be isolated to prevent further spreading of the viral infection. Recent approaches aim to predict a viral host based on the viral genome, often in combination with the potential host genome and arbitrarily selected features. These methods have a clear limitation in either the number of different hosts they can predict or the accuracy of their prediction. ResultsHere, we present a fast and accurate deep learning approach for viral host prediction, which is based on the viral genome sequence only. To ensure a high prediction accuracy, we developed an effective selection approach for the training data to avoid biases due to a highly unbalanced number of known sequences per virus-host combinations. We tested our deep neural network on three different virus species (influenza A, rabies lyssavirus, rotavirus A). We reached for each virus species an AUG between 0.93 and 0.98, outperforming previous approaches and allowing highly accurate predictions while only using fractions (100-400 bp) of the viral genome sequences. We show that deep neural networks are suitable to predict the host of a virus, even with a limited amount of sequences and highly unbalanced available data. The deep neural networks trained for this approach build the core of the virus-host predicting tool VIDHOP (Virus Deep learning HOst Prediction).

"Chen, H.; Li, X.; Yao, M.","Rats Sniff Off Toxic Air","Breathing air is a fundamental human need, yet its safety, when challenged by various harmful or lethal substances, is often not properly guarded. For example, air toxicity is currently monitored only for single or limited number of known toxicants, thus failing to fully warn against possible hazardous air. Here, we discovered that within minutes living rats emitted distinctive profiles of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via breath when exposed to various airborne toxicants such as endotoxin, O3, ricin, and CO2. Compared to background indoor air, when exposed to ricin or endotoxin aerosols breath-borne VOC levels, especially that of carbon disulfide, were shown to decrease; while their elevated levels were observed for O3 and CO2 exposures. A clear contrast in breath-borne VOCs profiles of rats between different toxicant exposures was observed with a statistical significance. Differences in MicroRNA regulations such as miR-33, miR-146a and miR-155 from rats blood samples revealed different mechanisms used by the rats in combating different air toxicant challenges. Similar to dogs, rats were found here to be able to sniff against toxic air by releasing a specific breath-borne VOC profile.

In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM).

Understanding the causes of the cost is considered the Holy Grail in the antibiotic resistance field, as it is the main determinant of the prevalence of resistances upon reducing antibiotics use. We show that DNA breaks can explain most of the variation in the cost of resistances common in pathogens. Here we demonstrate that targeting the RNase that degrades R-loops, which cause DNA breaks, exacerbates the cost of resistance. Consequently, lack of RNase HI function drives resistant clones to extinction in populations with high initial frequency of resistance, both in laboratory conditions and in a mouse model of gut colonization. Thus, RNase HI provides a target specific against resistant bacteria, which we validate using a repurposed drug. In summary, we revealed key mechanisms underlying the cost of antibiotic resistance that can be exploited to specifically eliminate resistant bacteria.","f162829ffeba4cedd16aaf7f09902182c5cf903c","True","","Antibiotic|the Holy Grail|RNase|RNase|RNase HI","biorxiv","","","","NORP|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2020-02-03","","10.1101/756767","biorxiv_medrxiv"

It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.","836190d366ba8e34c3a5df8a24d17a36fd503505","True","","2002/2003|2012/2015|2019/2020|Wuhan|CoV|CoV|2019-nCoV|S-RBD|Monte Carlo|2019-nCoV|about 73%|2019-nCoV|CoV","biorxiv","","","","DATE|DATE|DATE|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERSON","biorxiv","2020-02-04","","10.1101/2020.02.01.930537","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.","acb0e11e5763dbf7588ec435751a2ab705a783f1","True","","Novel Coronavirus|Wuhan|China|December 2019|30|RNA|2019-nCoV|Membrane (M)|Envelope|Nucleocapsid|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|39|eight|HBA|HLA-DR|Asia|Asia-Pacific Region|CoV|Diverse HLA|CoV|CoV","biorxiv","","","","PERSON|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|LOC|LOC|LAW|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON","biorxiv","2020-02-04","","10.1101/2020.01.29.925867","biorxiv_medrxiv"

ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-nCoV infection.

Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury.

C.","Structure-Guided Mutagenesis Alters Deubiquitinating Activity 2 and Attenuates Pathogenesis of a Murine Coronavirus","Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed PLP2. PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis. ImportanceCoronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (de-conjugating ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced pathogenesis in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.","3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3","True","","DUB|enzyme|DUB|DUB|DUB|DUB|Ala|DUB|DUBmut|DUBmut|DUBmut|DUB|DUBmut|DUBmut|day 5|PLP2-ubiquitin|DUB|2|DUB|DUB|DUB|DUB|DUB|PLP2/DUB","biorxiv","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE","biorxiv","2020-02-04","","10.1101/782409","biorxiv_medrxiv"

"Pfab, J.; Si, D.","DeepTracer: Predicting Backbone Atomic Structure from High Resolution Cryo-EM Density Maps of Protein Complexes","MotivationAccurately determining the atomic structure of proteins represents a fundamental problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm. ResultsWe trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 different types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly improved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours. AvailabilityThe repository of this project will be published.

We tracked growth, gamete formation and cell survival across many environments for nearly 1000 genome sequenced isolates and found a remarkable dichotomy between domesticated and wild yeasts. Wild yeasts near uniformly trigger meiosis and sporulate when encountering nutrient depletions, whereas domestication relaxed selection on sexual reproduction and favoured survival as quiescent cells. Domestication also systematically enhanced fermentative over respiratory traits while decreasing stress tolerance. We show that this yeast domestication syndrome was driven by aneuploidies and gene function losses that emerged independently in multiple domesticated lineages during the species recent evolutionary history. We found domestication to be the most dramatic event in budding yeast evolution, raising questions on how much domestication has distorted our understanding of this key model species.","329dfdd2fbe4b3c510c5329219bfd33764ab1710","True","","nearly 1000","biorxiv","","","","CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-02-13","","10.1101/2020.02.08.939314","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear. ObjectivesWe aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS. MethodsData on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS. Measurements and main resultsAs of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic. ConclusionsNCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective.

However, this has been poorly characterised in apicomplexans, a major phylum of some of the most important global parasites. Efforts have been hampered by atypical transcriptomic features, such as the high AT content of Plasmodium RNA, but also the limitations of short read sequencing in deciphering complex splicing events. In this study, we utilised the long read direct RNA sequencing platform developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to survey the alternative splicing landscape of Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum. We find that while native RNA sequencing has a reduced throughput, it allows us to obtain full-length or near full-length transcripts with comparable quantification to Illumina sequencing. By comparing this data with available gene models, we find widespread alternative splicing, particular intron retention, in these parasites. Most of these transcripts contain premature stop codons, suggesting that in these parasites, alternative splicing represents a pathway to transcriptomic diversity, rather than expanding proteomic diversity. Moreover, alternative splicing rates are comparable between parasites, suggesting a shared splicing machinery, despite notable transcriptomic differences between the parasites. This work highlights a strategy in using long read sequencing to understand splicing events at the whole transcript level, and has implications in future interpretation of RNA-seq studies.","56a81431a148344381a1da80c877885f3f3d6d59","True","","Plasmodium RNA|RNA|Oxford Nanopore Technologies|Plasmodium|RNA|Illumina|RNA-seq","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2020-02-17","","10.1101/2020.02.16.946699","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS and MERS, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene. We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the 2019-nCoV involving the RBD. Compared with bat isolates, the recent ancestors of 2019-nCoV accumulated a high number of amino acid substitutions in the RBD and likewise in a region of polyprotein Orf1a that is critical for viral replication and transcription. Among these recent mutations, we identify amino acid substitutions common to the SARS 2003 outbreak isolates in positions 427N and 436Y, indicating potential adaptive convergent evolution. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that appears to interact with the human ACE2 receptor. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the 2019-nCoV virus whereby the 2019-nCoV ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, those recombinants underwent convergent evolution.","69008e4d4e158ae9484c3821e4384aa5948c3209","True","","2019-nCoV|Wuhan|China|the Receptor Binding Domain|RBD|Spike|at least 11 years ago|2019-nCoV|RBD|2019-nCoV|RBD|2003|427N|436Y|436Y|two|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|first|RBD|2009","biorxiv","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG|DATE","biorxiv","2020-02-18","","10.1101/2020.02.10.942748","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that the presence of this structural loop in 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability and transmission.","7ab9f9fcea519ebce527c3ede8091beedbb26ad9","True","","2019|2019-nCoV|Hubei|China|2019-nCoV|CoV|CoV|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|CoV|CoV|CoV|2019-nCoV","biorxiv","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-02-18","","10.1101/2020.02.10.942185","biorxiv_medrxiv"

ACE2 is also suggested to be the receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is causing a serious epidemic in China manifested with severe respiratory syndrome. B0AT1 (SLC6A19) is a neutral amino acid transporter whose surface expression in intestinal cells requires ACE2. Here we present the 2.9 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1. The complex, assembled as a dimer of ACE2-B0AT1 heterodimers, exhibits open and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains (PDs) of ACE2. A newly resolved Collectrin-like domain (CLD) on ACE2 mediates homo-dimerization. Structural modelling suggests that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins simultaneously, providing important clues to the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.","b705170c7527f5bc6842d90bf443fa9f9ee00bf9","True","","Angiotensin|enzyme 2|CoV|2019-nCoV|China|B0AT1|SLC6A19|2.9|B0AT1|Collectrin|CLD|ACE2|ACE2-B0AT1|two","biorxiv","","","","GPE|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|FAC|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-02-18","","10.1101/2020.02.17.951848","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr, in mouse hepatocytes. CasRx-mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate complex metabolism networks. Moreover, the AAV (adeno-associated virus)-mediated delivery of CasRx and Pcsk9 sgRNAs into mouse liver successfully decreased serum PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels. Importantly, CasRx-mediated knockdown of Pcsk9 is reversible and Pcsk9 could be repeatedly down-regulated, providing an effective strategy to reversibly modulate metabolic genes. The present work supplies a successful proof-of-concept trial that suggests efficient and regulatory knockdown of target metabolic genes for a designed metabolism modulation in the liver.","a8be6ba53508e988c2c8c153478ff615b0d77687","True","","RNA|CRISPR/Cas9-mediated|RNA|RNA|Cas13d|RNA|CRISPR|Cas13d|CasRx|RNA|HEK293|RNA|Cas13d|CasRx|Pten|sgRNA|AAV|CasRx|PCSK9|CasRx","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|PERSON|PRODUCT|GPE|GPE|GPE","biorxiv","2020-02-19","","10.1101/2020.02.17.945014","biorxiv_medrxiv"

While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus.

COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearmans rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.","bb8e3d331bb2975e1c644c8729b842797da2d626","True","","February 20, 2020|2019|COVID-19|30|2130|more than 75500|COVID-19|between November 2002|July 2003|8098|9.6%|774|COVID-19|2.8%|20 February|75752|a few weeks|December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020|COVID-19|COVID-19|Spearmans|over 5000|61.8 million|COVID-19|Sarbecovirus|Betacoronavirus|a few minutes","biorxiv","","","","DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|PERSON|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|TIME","biorxiv","2020-02-20","","10.1101/2020.02.03.932350","biorxiv_medrxiv"

To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4-/- mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4-/- mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4-/- mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4s impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis.

"Su, Z.; Wu, Y.","A Multiscale and Comparative Model for Receptor Binding of 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the Implication of its Life Cycle in Host Cells","The respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from China and caused more than 1000 death globally since December 2019. This new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS.","78e49fdb6f0aa9924a5b510341d52b618fff0ca6","True","","China|more than 1000|December 2019|2019|2019-nCoV|Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2|seventeen years ago|S|2019-nCoV.|S|2019-nCoV|one","biorxiv","","","","GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|LAW|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-02-21","","10.1101/2020.02.20.958272","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"He, J.; Tao, H.; Yan, Y.; Huang, S.-Y.; Xiao, Y.","Molecular mechanism of evolution and human infection with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)","Since December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has hit the city of Wuhan in the Hubei Province. With the continuous development of the epidemic, it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines. The spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality. Previous studies showed that 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to human SARS-CoV and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). However, the molecular mechanisms of 2019-nCoV binding to human ACE2 and evolution of 2019-nCoV remain unclear. In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBD systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was shown that the RBD-ACE2 binding free energy for 2019-nCoV is significantly lower than that for SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that 2019-nCoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shows a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-nCoV because SARS-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. It was also revealed that the RBD of 2019-nCoV is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ACE2, compared to the RBD of SARS-CoV. That means that 2019-nCoV will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than SARS-CoV. With the rising temperature, 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV, and get controlled more easily. The present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-nCoV.","","False","","December, 2019|2019-nCoV|Wuhan|the Hubei Province|2019-nCoV|CoV|RBD|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|RBD|RBD|2019-nCoV|CoV|MD|RBD|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|SARS-CoV.|2019-nCoV|RBD|2019-nCoV|RBD|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|CoV|2019-nCoV.","biorxiv","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-02-21","","10.1101/2020.02.17.952903","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain.

Large RNA virus genomes, such as from Coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and to manipulate in E. coli hosts due to size and occasional instability1-3. Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse genetics platform for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA, which was then used to rescue viable virus. Based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-24 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments. The technical advance we describe here allows to rapidly responding to emerging viruses as it enables the generation and functional characterization of evolving RNA virus variants - in real-time - during an outbreak.","","False","","Coronaviruses|3|RNA|RNA|the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae|Paramyxoviridae|one|TAR|YAC|RNA|SARS-CoV-24|only a week|RNA","biorxiv","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG","biorxiv","2020-02-21","","10.1101/2020.02.21.959817","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted "CellPhoneDB" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.","22f3be8bbf6d792549b7a6088df7440e425cb34f","True","","2019-nCoV|December 2019|Wuhan|Hubei|China|Angiotensin|2019-nCov|2019-nCoV|119|13|51|RNA|400|13|ANPEP|DPP4|ENPEP|DPP4|ENPEP|CoVs|CellPhoneDB|CoV","biorxiv","","","","CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|PRODUCT|PERSON|PERSON","biorxiv","2020-02-21","","10.1101/2020.02.16.951913","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response. Overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.","d01e580a45c457c7c200cd884e746b4d836e2ea9","True","","Middle East|Coronavirus S|69-87|MERS S|HKU1|HIV-1|Lassa","biorxiv","","","","LOC|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG","biorxiv","2020-02-21","","10.1101/2020.02.20.957472","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Zhang, Q.; Zhao, Q.","Inactivating porcine coronavirus before nuclei acid isolation with the temperature higher than 56 °C damages its genome integrity seriously","2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is the pathogen of Corona Virus Disease 2019. Nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV is one of the key indicators for clinical diagnosis. However, the positive rate is only 30-50%. Currently, fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR technology is mainly used to detect 2019-nCoV. According to "The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition)" issued by National Health and Commission of China and "The Experts Consensus on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV" released by Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine, the human samples must be placed under 56{degrees}C or higher to inactivate the viruses in order to keep the inspectors from virus infection before the nucleic acids were isolated as the template of qRT-PCR. In this study, we demonstrated that the virus inactivation treatment disrupts its genome integrity seriously when using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (vaccine), a kind of coronavirus, as a model. Our results showed that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation of 56 {degrees}C for 30 minutes and only 3.36% left after the inactivation of 92 {degrees}C for 5 minutes when the samples were preserved by Hanks solution, one of an isotonic salt solutions currently suggested. However, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 {degrees}C or higher if the samples were preserved with an optimized solution to protect the RNA from being disrupted. We therefore highly recommend to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV genome and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage.","9aef9e1c22896809852ec6c94e413aff33b3d9cf","True","","Coronavirus|2019-nCoV|Corona Virus Disease|2019|Nucleic|2019-nCoV|one|only 30-50%|RT-PCR|2019-nCoV.|The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection|2019-nCoV|Fourth Edition|National Health and Commission|China|The Experts Consensus on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV|Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine|56{degrees}C|only 50.11%|56|30 minutes|only 3.36%|92|5 minutes|Hanks|one|56|RNA|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV","biorxiv","","","","PERSON|CARDINAL|FAC|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|WORK_OF_ART|CARDINAL|WORK_OF_ART|ORG|GPE|WORK_OF_ART|ORG|PERSON|PERCENT|CARDINAL|TIME|PERCENT|CARDINAL|TIME|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-02-22","","10.1101/2020.02.20.958785","biorxiv_medrxiv"

In this study, we targeted viral pathogens, included carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (CPPV-1), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), coronavirus (CoV), and canine morbillivirus (CMV), using molecular screening. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the target pathogens were evaluated. Through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we aimed to clarify the phylogenetic relationship of isolated viral pathogens between leopard cats and domestic carnivores. Samples from 23 and 29 leopard cats that were live-trapped and found dead, respectively, were collected from Miaoli County from 2015 to 2019 in northwestern Taiwan. CPPV-1 and coronavirus were detected in leopard cats. The prevalence (95% confidence interval) of CPPV-1, and CoV was 63.5% (50.4%-76.6%) and 8.8% (0%-18.4%), respectively. The majority of sequences of each CPPV-1 strain amplified from Taiwanese leopard cats and domestic carnivores were identical. All the amplified CoV sequences from leopard cats were identified as feline coronavirus. The spatial and temporal aggregation of CPPV-1 infection in leopard cats was not determined in the sampling area, which indicated a wide distribution of CPPV-1 in the leopard cat habitat. We consider sympatric domestic carnivores to be the probable primary reservoir for the pathogens identified. We strongly recommend establishing efforts to manage CPPV-1 and FCoV in the leopard cat habitat, with an emphasis on vaccination programs and population control measures for free-roaming dogs and cats. IMPORTANCEThe leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) is an endangered species in Taiwan. The effects of infectious diseases on the wildlife population have increasingly been recognized. In this study, we targeted highly pathogenic viral pathogens in wild cat species, included carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (CPPV-1), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), coronavirus (CoV), and canine morbillivirus (CMV), using molecular screening. Furthermore, we collected the epidemiological and phylogenetic data to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of the target pathogens in the wild leopard cat population and identified the possible origin of target pathogens. Based on our study, we consider sympatric domestic carnivores to be the probable primary reservoir for the pathogens identified.

Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 [A] and 2.83 [A] resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of -, {beta}-, {gamma}-, and {delta}-coronavirus spikes. The results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses.

"Zhao, Z.; Cui, H.; Song, W.; Ru, X.; Zhou, W.; Yu, X.","A simple magnetic nanoparticles-based viral RNA extraction method for efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2","1The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originating from Wuhan, China, draws worldwide concerns due to its long incubation period and strong infectivity. Although RT-PCR-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. To address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (PC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcMNPs), and the development of pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction method for the sensitive detection of COVID-19 causing virus, the SARS-CoV-2. This method combines the lysis and binding steps into one step, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RT-PCR reactions. The simplified process can purify viral RNA from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. By identifying two different regions (ORFlab and N gene) of viral RNA, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 105 copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved. Benefitting from the simplicity and excellent performances, this new extraction method can dramatically reduce the turn-around time and operational requirements in current molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, in particular for the early clinical diagnosis.","7207df5b61e93fa5a2b6e720c91aed05270e81be","True","","2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|RT-PCR|RNA|COVID-19|one|RT-PCR reactions|RNA|20|two|ORFlab|RNA|10|105|COVID-19","biorxiv","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","biorxiv","2020-02-27","","10.1101/2020.02.22.961268","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Parag, K. V.; Donnelly, C. A.","Adaptive Estimation for Epidemic Renewal and Phylogenetic Skyline Models","Estimating temporal changes in a target population from phylogenetic or count data is an important problem in ecology and epidemiology. Reliable estimates can provide key insights into the climatic and biological drivers influencing the diversity or structure of that population and evidence hypotheses concerning its future growth or decline. In infectious disease applications, the individuals infected across an epidemic form the target population. The renewal model estimates the effective reproduction number, R, of the epidemic from counts of its observed cases. The skyline model infers the effective population size, N, underlying a phylogeny of sequences sampled from that epidemic. Practically, R measures ongoing epidemic growth while N informs on historical caseload. While both models solve distinct problems, the reliability of their estimates depends on p-dimensional piecewise-constant functions. If p is misspecified, the model might underfit significant changes or overfit noise and promote a spurious understanding of the epidemic, which might misguide intervention policies or misinform forecasts. Surprisingly, no transparent yet principled approach for optimising p exists. Usually, p is heuristically set, or obscurely controlled via complex algorithms. We present a computable and interpretable p-selection method based on the minimum description length (MDL) formalism of information theory. Unlike many standard model selection techniques, MDL accounts for the additional statistical complexity induced by how parameters interact. As a result, our method optimises p so that R and N estimates properly adapt to the available data. It also outperforms comparable Akaike and Bayesian information criteria on several classification problems. Our approach requires some knowledge of the parameter space and exposes the similarities between renewal and skyline models.","2ffc83b88bc84615273e97d8109e5439ce4dce60","True","","N|N|Bayesian","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG|NORP","biorxiv","2020-02-27","","10.1101/703751","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Unfortunately, no effective and specific drugs capable of reversing immunosuppression are available for clinical use. Increasing evidence implicates vitamin D receptor (VDR) involved in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Herein, artesunate (AS) was discovered to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression and its molecular mechanism is investigated. Experimental ApproachEffect of artesunate on sepsis-induced immunosuppression was investigated in mice and in vitro. VDR was predicted to be an interacted candidate of AS by bioinformatics predict, then identified using PCR and immunoblotting. VDR, ATG16L1 and NF-{kappa}B p65 were modified to investigate the alteration of ASs effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines release, bacteria clearance and autophagy activities in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Key ResultsAS significantly reduced the mortality of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis immunosuppression mice challenged with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and enhanced proinflammatory cytokines release and bacterial clearance to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, AS interacted with VDR thereby inhibited the nuclear translocation of VDR, then influencing ATG16L1 transcription and subsequent autophagy activity. In addition, AS inhibited physical interaction between VDR and NF-{kappa}B p65 in LPS tolerance macrophages, then promoted nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B p65, which activated the transcription of NF-{kappa}B p65 target genes such as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion and ImplicationsOur findings provide an evidence that AS interacted with VDR to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in an autophagy and NF-{kappa}B dependent way, highlighting a novel approach for sepsis treatment and drug repurposing of AS in the future.","0a32446730827ad8152c6a61e4738e4e0b231412","True","","PurposeImmunosuppression|VDR|Herein|VDR|AS|PCR|VDR|NF-{kappa}B|Pseudomonas Aeruginosa|AS|VDR|VDR|AS|VDR|NF-{kappa}B|LPS|NF-{kappa}B|NF-{kappa}B|ImplicationsOur|AS|VDR|NF-{kappa}B|AS","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG","biorxiv","2020-02-27","","10.1101/2020.02.26.966143","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis.

Recent studies show that spike (S) proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may use the same host cell receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S is much higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein, explaining that why 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we reported that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Basing on findings here, we propose that coronavirus infection can positively induce its cellular entry receptor to accelerate their replication and spread, thus drugs targeting ACE2 expression may be prepared for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of viruses.","c8b6f2752a842dd9eb9c50a82112748ef10ba259","True","","2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|CoV|2019-nCoV|CoV S|2019-nCoV|CoV","biorxiv","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON","biorxiv","2020-02-27","","10.1101/2020.02.24.963348","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the {beta}-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity.

To reveal the evolution mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 - 4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent selective pressure.

However, the mechanisms responsible for infection and molecular evolution of this virus remained unclear. MethodsWe collected and analyzed 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV including 11 novel genomes from patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other coronaviruses. ResultsSystematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed co-circulation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site. ConclusionsOur studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019-nCoV. Our results provided evidence suggesting that 2019-nCoV may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a cleavage site insertion.

The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes.

TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information.

These methods are typically reliant on excising K-length substrings of the input sequence, called K-mers5. In the context of machine learning, K-mer based feature vectors have been used in applications ranging from amplicon sequencing classification to predictive modeling for antimicrobial resistance genes6,7,8. This can be seen as an analogy of the "bag-of-words" model successfully employed in natural language processing and computer vision for document and image classification9,10. Feature extraction techniques from natural language processing have previously been analogized to genomics data11; however, the "bag-of-words" approach is brittle in the RNA virus space due to the high intersequence variance and the exact matching requirement of K-mers. To reconcile the simplicity of "bag-of-words" methods with the complications presented by the intrinsic variance of RNA virus space, a method to resolve the fragility of extracted K-mers in a way that faithfully reflects an underlying biological phenomenon was devised. Our algorithm, Vorpal, allows the construction of interpretable linear models with clustered, representative degenerate K-mers as the input vector and, through regularization, sparse predictors of binary phenotypes as the output. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Vorpal by identifying nucleotide-level genomic motif predictors for binary phenotypes in three separate RNA virus clades; human pathogen vs. non-human pathogen in Orthocoronavirinae, hemorrhagic fever causing vs. non-hemorrhagic fever causing in Ebolavirus, and human-host vs. non-human host in Influenza A. The capacity of this approach for in silico identification of hypotheses which can be validated by direct experimentation, as well as identification of genomic targets for preemptive biosurveillance of emerging viruses, is discussed.

Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like [R] = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of "test-and-treat" interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We suggest that disease modelers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.","1d2947d5c0addcbbcfa71d87ea074a8b6ff2a973","True","","0|1","biorxiv","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.03.02.974048","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be pre-adapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.","7bdceb3b947ec934199d0c97fb9ec5a0e2bac776","True","","Coronavirus Disease 2019|COVID-19|2019-nCoV|CoV|2|Darwinian|2019-nCoV|RBD|COVID-19|CoV|RBD|ORF3a|COVID-19|CoV|CoVs|RBD|2019-nCoV|CoV","biorxiv","","","","ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|LOC|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON","biorxiv","2020-03-04","","10.1101/2020.03.04.975995","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The third extracellular domain of NTCP presents a stretch of nine aminoacids (KGIVISLVL) that is characterized by pronounced hydrophobicity and serves as receptor for a protein, preS1, showing the hydrophobic epta-peptide sequence NPLGFFP. Vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) is a multifunctional protein that is characterized by two hydrophobic regions able to bind fatty acids and vitamin D, respectively. Here we demonstrate that NTCP and DBP-MAF show significant sequence similarities as far as hydrophobic stretches of aminoacids are concerned. Alignment of the sequence of seven aminoacids preceding the 157-KGIVISLVL-165 stretch of NTCP shows four aminoacids that are identical to those of the corresponding sequence of DBP-MAF, and two that are conserved substitutions. In addition, in the sequence of DBP-MAF that is aligned with the sequence YKGIVISLVL of NTCP, there are two contiguous negatively charged aminoacids (ED) and, in the preceding epta-peptide sequence, there are three negatively charged aminoacids (D-ED), whereas in the corresponding sequence of NTCP there are only two (D--D) that are not contiguous. This concentration of negatively charged aminoacids may be involved in binding of protein inserts characterized by high density of positively charges residues. The alternating hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions described in this paper may help elucidating the biological roles of these proteins as far as protein-protein interactions are concerned.","0fa18c47543c3ce69a3c9e4d77958c4d3691b1ed","True","","third|NTCP|nine|preS1|NPLGFFP|Vitamin D-binding|two|seven|NTCP|four|two|NTCP|two|ED|three|D-ED|NTCP","biorxiv","","","","ORDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-05","","10.1101/2020.03.03.975524","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells1. The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8. However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM (SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.","1b4ab28a9391d516e1753874c73d2d244104f825","True","","RBD|Betacoronaviruses|two|PDZ|Motif|infection7,8|three|Amantadine|Hexamethylene amiloride9,10|ARDS","biorxiv","","","","ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|NORP|PERSON|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.02.17.952895","biorxiv_medrxiv"

A.; Joffrin, L.; Lebarbenchon, C.; Mavingui, P.","Partial RdRp sequences offer a robust method for Coronavirus subgenus classification","The recent reclassification of the Riboviria, and the introduction of multiple new taxonomic categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to designate specific viral lineages. While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, "MyCoV", which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution. Importance StatementThe analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as Coronaviruses. Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To assist in this, we also provide the R package MyCoV which classifies user generated sequences.","20f2a638e2c9a1917b7c001c371335da3d288505","True","","Riboviria|Coronaviridae|Orthocoronavirinae|RNA|RNA|Bayesian|more than 7000|between taxa|Importance StatementThe|Coronaviruses|Coronaviruses|MyCoV","biorxiv","","","","GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON","biorxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.02.974311","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. We used homology-based protein-protein docking, binding energy estimation, and decomposition, aiming to predict both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the interaction. Using in silico structural modelling, we brought additional evidence that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

Host immune responses to CoV are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoV are not well characterized2. Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of CoV in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging CoV.","d23c6a066a58dbe5ec5fa57e67f1b795337299f7","True","","Zoonotic coronaviruses|2|CoV|CoV|6|Middle East|Mechanistic|CoV|Ly6e|CoV|Ly6e|Ly6e|CoV|CoV|CoV","biorxiv","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|LOC|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|NORP|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON","biorxiv","2020-03-07","","10.1101/2020.03.05.979260","biorxiv_medrxiv"

While genetically distinct from SARS-CoV, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (RBD) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for virus entry. Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9) was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit.

To understand the structural connectivity of cortical and subcortical circuits in the healthy human brain could thus be of pivotal importance for detecting changes in this circuitry and to start early intervention, to assess the progress of movement rehabilitation, or the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches in neuropsychiatry. While conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography, or magnetoencephalography are able to provide detailed information about connectivity at the macro level, the sensitivity and specificity these imaging techniques put limits on the amount of detail one can obtain when measuring in vivo connectivity of human basal ganglia and thalamus.

RNA from diseased birds was extracted and pooled based on tissue type, host species and clinical manifestation for metagenomic sequencing. Using a bulk and unbiased meta-transcriptomic approach, combined with careful clinical investigation and histopathology, we identified a number of novel viruses from the families Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Circoviridae in common urban wild birds including Australian magpies, magpie lark, pied currawongs, Australian ravens, and rainbow lorikeets. In each case the presence of the virus was confirmed by RT-PCR. These data revealed a number of candidate viral pathogens that may contribute to coronary, skeletal muscle, vascular and neuropathology in birds of the Corvidae and Artamidae families, and neuropathology in members of the Psittaculidae. The existence of such a diverse virome in urban avian species highlights the importance and challenges in elucidating the etiology and ecology of wildlife pathogens in urban environments.

"Andersen, E.; Evans, K. S.","A single locus underlies variation in Caenorhabditis elegans chemotherapeutic responses","Pleiotropy, the concept that a single gene controls multiple distinct traits, is prevalent in most organisms and has broad implications for medicine and agriculture. Identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying pleiotropy has the power to unveil previously unknown biological connections between seemingly unrelated traits. Additionally, the discovery of pleiotropic genes increases our understanding of both genetic and phenotypic complexity by characterizing novel gene functions. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has been used to identify several pleiotropic regions in many organisms. However, gene knockout studies are needed to eliminate the possibility of tightly linked, non-pleiotropic loci. Here, we use a panel of 296 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines of Caenorhabditis elegans and a high-throughput fitness assay to identify a single large-effect QTL on the center of chromosome V associated with variation in responses to eight chemotherapeutics. We validate this QTL with near-isogenic lines and pair genome-wide gene expression data with drug response traits to perform mediation analysis, leading to the identification of a pleiotropic candidate gene, scb-1. Using deletion strains created by genome editing, we show that scb-1, which was previously implicated in response to bleomycin, also underlies responses to other double-strand DNA break-inducing chemotherapeutics. This finding provides new evidence for the role of scb-1 in the nematode drug response and highlights the power of mediation analysis to identify causal genes.","e476334b4f415f8fde5e2f560fd1ad0fa314af90","True","","Pleiotropy|QTL|296|Caenorhabditis|QTL|eight|QTL","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-09","","10.1101/2020.03.09.984393","biorxiv_medrxiv"

An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within COVID-19 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for that virus.","a2a6e262098539eb875a26800d9f6d3d0d5d1875","True","","2013-2016|West Africa EBOV|30|26|at least one|EBOV|EBOV|NP|the EBOV NP|9-amino|NP44-52|YQVNNLEEI|EBOV NP|EBOV|NP44-52|EBOV|COVID-19|HLA|CTL","biorxiv","","","","DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|GPE|PRODUCT|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-09","","10.1101/2020.02.25.963546","biorxiv_medrxiv"

How the distances between nucleosomes (spacing), and between phasing sites and nucleosomes are determined remains unclear, and specifically, how ATP dependent chromatin remodelers impact these features. Here, we used genome-wide reconstitution to probe how Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP dependent remodelers generate phased arrays of regularly spaced nucleosomes. We find that remodelers bear a functional element named the ruler that determines spacing and phasing in a remodeler-specific way. We use structure-based mutagenesis to identify and tune the ruler element residing in the Nhp10 and Arp8 modules of the INO80 remodeler complex. Generally, we propose that a remodeler ruler regulates nucleosome sliding direction bias in response to (epi)genetic information. This finally conceptualizes how remodeler-mediated nucleosome dynamics determine stable steady-state nucleosome positioning relative to other nucleosomes, DNA bound factors, DNA ends and DNA sequence elements.","da3aa20131ac2805c0d9e1b29f094683479ab5b7","True","","Nhp10|INO80","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-09","","10.1101/2020.02.28.969618","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS-CoV infection to inform treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel coronavirus is much more sensitive to type I interferon pretreatment. We subsequently examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading frame (ORF) 3b and significant changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2.

The primer set seems to have been adapted already by many researchers worldwide and contributed for the high-quality and prompt genome epidemiology of this potential pandemic virus. We have also seen the great performance of their primer set and protocol; the primer set was able to amplify all desired PCR products with fairy small amplification bias from clinical samples with relatively high viral load. However, we observed acute drop of reads derived from two particular PCR products, 18 and 76, out of the 98 designated products as sample's viral load decreases. We suspected the reason for this low coverage issue was due to dimer formation between primers used to amplify those two PCR products. Here, we propose replacing just one of those primers, nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT(-), to a newly designed primer. The result of the replacement of primer showed improvement in coverage at both regions targeted by the products, 18 and 76.

While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied. Methods: Thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration. Results: The ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow. Conclusions: Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","2989bf36068372cfedef82f58f4777e60ccbcfaa","True","","COVID-19|Thirty-five|three|Patient Areas|Medical Staff Areas|Renmin Hospital|Wuhan University|Wuchang Fangcang|Fangcang|Public Areas|PUA|Wuhan|China|RNA|RNA|ICU|CCU|Renmin|Fangcang|ICU|Fangcang|Fangcang MSA|Renmin|PUA","biorxiv","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-10","","10.1101/2020.03.08.982637","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However, our understanding of pathogen jumps is primarily based around viruses, despite bacteria accounting for the greatest proportion of zoonoses. Because bacterial pathogens in bats (Order: Chiroptera) can have conservation and human health consequences, studies that examine the ecological and evolutionary drivers of bacterial prevalence and barriers to pathogen sharing are crucially needed. We here studied hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (i.e., hemoplasmas) across a species-rich bat community in Belize over two years. Across 469 bats spanning 33 species, half of individuals and two-thirds of species were hemoplasma positive. Infection prevalence was higher for males and for species with larger body mass and colony sizes. Hemoplasmas displayed high genetic diversity (21 novel genotypes) and strong host specificity. Evolutionary patterns supported co-divergence of bats and bacterial genotypes alongside phylogenetically constrained host shifts. Bat species centrality to the network of shared hemoplasma genotypes was phylogenetically clustered and unrelated to prevalence, further suggesting rare-but detectable-bacterial sharing between species. Our study highlights the importance of using fine phylogenetic scales when assessing host specificity and suggests phylogenetic similarity may play a key role in host shifts for not only viruses but also bacteria. Such work more broadly contributes to increasing efforts to understand cross-species transmission and epidemiological consequences of bacterial pathogens.","3452e28df999e004bb22ce3cedc4799072810eeb","True","","Mycoplasma|Belize|two years|469|33|half|two-thirds|21|Bat","biorxiv","","","","PERSON|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON","biorxiv","2019-12-23","","10.1101/2019.12.21.885921","biorxiv_medrxiv"

To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. Therefore, we herein used a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than that of EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, potently inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emerging SARSr-CoVs.","d5a1fed3fc7baf4e31c897ec639995106e9fae78","True","","Wuhan|China|first|six|CoV|1.3|15.8 nM|about 241-|149-fold|CoV|CoV|4|HCoV-OC43|SARSr-CoVs","biorxiv","","","","GPE|GPE|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|QUANTITY","biorxiv","2020-03-12","","10.1101/2020.03.09.983247","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The likelihood of cross-species transmission is related to phenotypic plasticity of a virus and its capacity to produce genetically variable progeny. Herein a model is described connecting the production of genetic variability with increasing genome size. Comparing all known zoonotic viral genome sizes to known non-zoonotic viral genome sizes demonstrates that zoonotic viruses have significantly larger genomes. These results support the notion that large viral genomes are important in producing new zoonotic disease, and suggest that genome size may be a useful surrogate in screening for potential zoonotic viruses.","7698ec48a89a682cb52c066e293567fa3e83b7dd","True","","Herein","biorxiv","","","","PERSON","biorxiv","2020-03-11","","10.1101/2020.03.10.986109","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We compare the interaction between the human ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with that of other pathogenic coronaviruses using molecular dynamics simulations. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 recognize ACE2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ACE2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. The SARS-CoV-2–ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to SARS-CoV.

Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knocking-out cells. We also proposed the drug combination of DAA and HTA was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an EC50 of 17nM and SI value >5882 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells so far. This work demonstrates that both our self-designed candidates and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to COVID-19 circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses mutate or not.","a59a1e31a7d2edf1be120c4a13a454bed64b1593","True","","RNA|DAA|HTA|Herein|two|DHODH|S312|S416|RNA|H1N1|H3N2|H9N2|Zika|first|DHODH|DHODH|DAA|HTA|S416|SI|5882|Leflunomide/Teriflunomide|COVID-19","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|GPE|PERSON|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-12","","10.1101/2020.03.11.983056","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.","d070dc3ef2125fd891f3e023598831e23a145880","True","","COVID-19|CoV|CoV|1|PARP1|CVL218|COVID-19|CVL218|CVL218|CpG|CVL218|CVL218|PARP1|PARP1|CVL218|COVID-19","biorxiv","","","","ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-12","","10.1101/2020.03.11.986836","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The effective concentration of ciclesonide to block SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19) replication (EC90) was 6.3 μM. After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reverse genetics. A recombinant virus with the mutation was also resistant to ciclesonide suppression of viral replication.

The deletion also removes the ORF8 transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS), which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the N gene. We also found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks. During the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population [1], and similar variation has since been observed across SARS-related CoVs in humans and bats. Overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in ORF8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus [2]. This is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human SARS cases possessed an ORF8 deletion that may be associated with host adaptation [1].

NiV causes severe disease and death in people with over 75% case fatality rate. It is a public health concern and has the potential to become a global pandemic. Lack of treatment has forced the containment methods to be restricted to isolation and surveillance. WHO’s ‘R&D Blueprint list of priority diseases’ (2018) indicates that there is an urgent need for accelerated research & development for addressing NiV.Materials & MethodsIn the quest for druglike NiV inhibitors (NVIs) a thorough literature search followed by systematic data curation was conducted. Rigorous data analysis was done with curated NVIs for prioritizing druglike compounds. For the same, more than 1800 descriptors of NVIs were computed and comparative analysis was performed with the FDA approved small molecules and antivirals. These compounds were further evaluated through PAINS filter to study their toxicity profile. Simultaneously, compounds were also prioritized based on the robustness of the assays through which they were identified.ResultsOur efforts lead to the creation of a well-curated structured knowledgebase of 182 NVIs with 98 small molecule inhibitors. The reported IC50/EC50 values for some of these inhibitors are in the nanomolar range – as low as 0.47 nM. In order to prioritize these inhibitors, we performed several tests and applied filters to identify drug-like non-toxic compounds. Of 98, a few compounds passed DruLito & PAINS filters exhibiting drug-like properties and were also prioritized in an independent screen based only the assay robustness. The NVIs have diverse structural features and offer a wide spectrum of ways in which they can be developed further as druglike molecules.ConclusionWe report a knowledgebase for furthering the development of NVIs. The platform has a diverse set of 98 NVIs of which a few have been prioritized based on a combined evidence strategy.

Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrate its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produces clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allows for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis.

Polyclonal antibody of high titer and sensitivity was obtained using Wastar rats immunization method and is then used to determine of the expression of ACE2 using immunohistochemistry. The sequence of ACE2 in pigs covered 2418 nucleotides and coded 805 amino acid (aa) residues. Sequence homology analysis showed that the ACE2 sequence in pigs is highly conserved among species at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Genetic evolution analysis revealed that ACE2 gene in pigs has the shortest genetic distance with that in goats while residing in a totally different branch from that in zebra fishes. Analysis of protein structure predicted that ACE2 protein is a transmembrane secreted protein with high hydrophilicity, containing a signal peptide sequences locating between 1aa to 17aa. The ACE2 fusion protein expressed (under the induction with 1.0 mmol/L IPTG for 10 h) was of approximately 100 kDa and mainly existed in inclusion body. Wastar rats immunization showed that the titer of the anti-ACE2 antiserum in rats was 1: 3200. Western blot showed that the antibody binds specifically.

Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3’-fluoro-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3’-azido-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agents.","28884786bfd579216f563c278e1730290dd4ccb8","True","","emergency.1|FDA|Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir|Sofosbuvir|RNA|RNA|Sofosbuvir|two|Alovudine|FDA|two|3’-fluoro-3’-deoxythymidine|3’-azido-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate|Alovudine|98%|CoV|RdRps","biorxiv","","","","GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|PERSON|PERSON","biorxiv","2020-03-14","","10.1101/2020.03.12.989186","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The other potential transmission routes remain to be further researched. In some clinical cases, samples of tears and conjunctival secretions from both SARS-CoV[1] and SARS-CoV-2 patients with conjunctivitis[2] displayed detectable viral RNA. A previous study reported the case of a clinician who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while working with patients under all safeguards except eye protection [2]. By contrast, no SARS-CoV-2 could be detected by RT-PCR in 114 conjunctival swabs samples from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [4]. Anatomically, the linkage of the ocular with respiratory tissues is primarily by the nasolacrimal system [5]. The potential extra-respiratory transmissible routes of SARS-CoV-2 via ocular remained unclear. Whether ocular conjunctiva is one of the portals that SARS-CoV-2 enters the host needs to be further research by laboratory-confirmation for providing significant data to oversight and prevention in people.","","False","","Corona Virus Disease|2019|COVID-19|RNA|2|RT-PCR|114|COVID-19|4|5","biorxiv","","","","FAC|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-03-14","","10.1101/2020.03.13.990036","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Recently, it has been reported that discharged patients in China and elsewhere were testing positive after recovering. However, it remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of “relapse” or “reinfection”. The longitudinal tracking of re-exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection. After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strain. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys. Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of COVID-19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Taken together, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design.","d1696944ff45daaa2f305405c54ba45b16f3c86c","True","","the Corona Virus Disease|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|7 days|half|5 days|COVID-19","biorxiv","","","","FAC|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-14","","10.1101/2020.03.13.990226","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Kraneveld","Accurate Identification of SARS-CoV-2 from Viral Genome Sequences using Deep Learning","AbstractOne of the reasons for the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the lack of accuracy in detection tools in the clinical field. Molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. For this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to other Coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. To tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. The proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus. Experiments on data from the Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify SARS-CoV-2, distinguishing it from other coronavirus strains, such as MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and SARS-CoV regardless of missing information and errors in sequencing (noise). From a dataset of 553 complete genome non-repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average accuracy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation, identifying SARS-CoV-2 with an AUC of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification. Then, using the same basis, we classify SARS-CoV-2 from 384 complete viral genome sequences with human host, that contain the gene ORF1ab from the NCBI with a 10-fold accuracy of 98.17%, a specificity of 0.9797 and sensitivity of 1.00. These preliminary results seem encouraging enough to identify deep learning as a promising research venue to develop assisted detection tests for SARS-CoV-2. At this end the interaction between viromics and deep learning, will hopefully help to solve global infection problems. In addition, we offer our code and processed data to be used for diagnostic purposes by medical doctors, virologists and scientists involved in solving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As more data become available we will update our system.","fa15a1608185e44b0bf4e66354533e1a05316535","True","","RT-PCR|Coronaviruses|the Novel Coronavirus Resource|HCoV|HCoV|HCoV|553|1,260|31,029|98.75%|10-fold|AUC|98%|0.9939|1.00|384|ORF1ab|NCBI|10-fold|98.17%|0.9797|1.00","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-03-14","","10.1101/2020.03.13.990242","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The knowledge of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Specifically, comparative analyses of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses, such as SARS-CoV, can reveal the common and/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system.Herein, we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibody-binding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of RBDs in isolation, without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties. Importantly, our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind/elicit antibodies. These results provide a rational basis to the observation that several SARS-CoV RDB-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. Furthermore, we correctly identify the region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD that is engaged by the cell receptor ACE2 during viral entry into host cells.The data, sequences and structures we present here can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.","2f6efc4edc0c9fffd3acc810efd8616e7772b28a","True","","CoV|Herein|the Receptor Binding Domain|RBD|Spike|RDB|RBD","biorxiv","","","","PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-14","","10.1101/2020.03.13.990267","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Dinman","Structural and functional conservation of the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift signal of SARS-CoV-2","Abstract17 years after the SARS-CoV epidemic, the world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural analyses reveal that the core -1 PRF signal, composed of the U UUA AAC slippery site and three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot is highly conserved. In contrast, the upstream attenuator hairpin is less well conserved. Functional assays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ablate -1 PRF activity. We suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibiting SARS-CoV mediated -1 PRF may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.","0d4432c32daefa6f0d711ca35eca81188e0bccdf","True","","years|CoV|COVID-19|COVID-19|more than a year|CoV|three|three","biorxiv","","","","DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-03-15","","10.1101/2020.03.13.991083","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Bats and pangolins are suspected as the reservoir and the intermediate host. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein plays the key role in the tight binding to human ACE2 for viral entry. In this study, we analyzed the worldwide RBD mutations and found 10 mutants under high positive selection pressure during the spread. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of three RBD mutants emerging in Wuhan, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and France were two orders of magnitude lower than the prototype Wuhan-Hu-1 strain due to the stabilization of the beta-sheet scaffold of the RBD. This indicated that the mutated viruses have evolved to acquire remarkably increased infectivity. Five France isolates and one Hong Kong isolate shared the same RBD mutation enhancing the binding affinity, which suggested that they may have originated as a novel sub-lineage. The KD values for the bat and the pangolin SARS-like CoV RBDs indicated that it would be difficult and unlikely for this bat SARS-like CoV to infect humans; however, the pangolin CoV is potentially infectious to humans with respect to its RBD. These analyses of critical mutations of the RBD provide further insights into the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2, presumably while under selection pressure. This enhancement of the SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to its host receptor ACE2 reveals a higher risk of more severe infections during a sustained pandemic of COVID-19 if no effective precautions are implemented.","2ba7dfd6227e7f64d80204770ccbe140afa78117","True","","Coronavirus Disease 2019|COVID-19|RBD|RBD|10|KD|three|RBD|Wuhan|Shenzhen|Hong Kong|France|two|Wuhan|RBD|Five|France|one|Hong Kong|RBD|KD|CoV|CoV|CoV|RBD|RBD|COVID-19","biorxiv","","","","ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.15.991844","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Molecular information on the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 Å. We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins.

We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the closed prefusion S structure, but is accessible in open conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.","ddc40ffc47069f3714c8da65843f36f41ed0f8bb","True","","several months|first|CoV|ACE-2|RBD|1.95|RBD|S|One|CR3022|ACE-2|RBD|CR3022|RBD|first","biorxiv","","","","DATE|ORDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORDINAL","biorxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.15.992883","biorxiv_medrxiv"

One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by using plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding the antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but also has important implications in vaccine development.","e49c9e5b4f77c5cdbf6fa77343d767d909548dea","True","","The World Health Organization|COVID-19|One","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.15.993097","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients. Our findings also provide an application of human organoids in investigating the tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which would facilitate novel drug discovery.","2757708c4f72260abefb9d74302d868165cbc1a4","True","","RNA","biorxiv","","","","ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.16.990317","biorxiv_medrxiv"

One reason is that the challenges underneath sequencing HCoV-19 directly from clinical samples have not been completely tackled. Here we illustrate the application of amplicon and hybrid capture (capture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual variations of HCoV-19 from clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral load.

Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed ~96% genomic similarity with bat CoV (RaTG13) and clustered together in phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, RaTG13 also showed 97.43% spike protein similarity with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that RaTG13 is the closest strain. However, RBD and key amino acid residues supposed to be crucial for human-to-human and cross-species transmission are homologues between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoVs. These results from our analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant virus of bat and pangolin CoVs. Moreover, this study also reports mutations in coding regions of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes suggesting the trajectory of the viral evolution. In short, our findings propose that homologous recombination has been occurred between bat and pangolin CoVs that triggered cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and, during the ongoing outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is still evolving for its adaptability.","443584f57419813b2f04054b239d4081489e80fb","True","","Coronavirus Disease 2019|COVID-19|CoV|97.43%|RaTG13|RBD|125","biorxiv","","","","ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL","biorxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.16.993816","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We expressed three versions of spike (S) proteins—receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 subunit and S ectodomain—in insect cells. RBD appears monomer in solutions, whereas S1 and S associate into homotrimer with substantial glycosylation. The three proteins confer excellent antigenicity with six convalescent COVID-19 patient sera. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer dominate in a unique conformation distinguished from the classic prefusion conformation of coronaviruses by the upper S1 region at lower position ∼15 Å proximal to viral membrane. Such conformation is proposed as an early prefusion state for the SARS-CoV-2 spike that may broaden the knowledge of coronavirus and facilitate vaccine development.","a8852f0f854746663fd96d09629d8b0db0d55a4a","True","","2019|COVID-19|2|three|RBD|RBD|S1|S|three|six|Cryo-electron","biorxiv","","","","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY","biorxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.16.994152","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Erik Procko","The sequence of human ACE2 is suboptimal for binding the S spike protein of SARS coronavirus 2","SUMMARYThe rapid and escalating spread of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses an immediate public health emergency, and no approved therapeutics or vaccines are currently available. The viral spike protein S binds ACE2 on host cells to initiate molecular events that release the viral genome intracellularly. Soluble ACE2 inhibits entry of both SARS and SARS-2 coronaviruses by acting as a decoy for S binding sites, and is a candidate for therapeutic and prophylactic development. Using deep mutagenesis, variants of ACE2 are identified with increased binding to the receptor binding domain of S at a cell surface. Mutations are found across the interface and also at buried sites where they are predicted to enhance folding and presentation of the interaction epitope. The N90-glycan on ACE2 hinders association. The mutational landscape offers a blueprint for engineering high affinity ACE2 receptors to meet this unprecedented challenge.","e05ece9c6fdb3e9942598685bb94748b97d88e16","True","","2|SARS-2|ACE2|N90-glycan|ACE2","biorxiv","","","","CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|NORP|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.16.994236","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The outcomes evaluated: feed intake, performance, body development, blood cells and metabolites, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), rumen fermentation, fecal scores and respiratory scores. All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4 – 60 d of age), and carryover effects on post-weaning (61 – 90 d of age) periods. The experimental units utilized were 29 newborn Holstein × Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth of 32.2 ± 5.2 kg. Experimental units were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON, n = 15) or a treatment group, consisting of supplementation of a blend of essential oils (BEO, n = 14) with1 g/d/calf (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China). During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted at 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, divided into two meals. The outcomes feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30 and 60 d of age for total blood cell count, weekly to determinate ß-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N and acetate:proprionate proportion - C2:C3) were measured each 14 days. A randomized complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of effect of BEO on all outcomes. An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes both adopting a C.I. = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of effect of BEO in MR on: feed intake, performance, body development and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 during pre and post-weaning (P ≤ 0.05). Similarly, the effect is significant for basophil (P ≤ 0.001) and platelet (P ≤ 0.05) counts in pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P ≤ 0.001), revealing a long-term treatment immunological effect. Lastly, the effect on fecal scores was also significant (P ≤ 0.05) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO. BEO contributed for ruminal manipulation on pre-weaning and carry over effect on post-weaning; immunity improvement and a decrease morbidity of neonatal diarrhea in pre-weaning phase.","744e302e6bbeb9fc1232e37418c2f8b5f8179989","True","","factor-1|IGF-1|4 – 60|61 – 90 d of age|29|Holstein × Gyr|5/8|Holstein|3/8|Gyr|32.2|± 5.2|CON|15|BEO|14|Apex Calf|China|5|15%|two|3 kg|two|daily|every three days|weekly|0|30|60|weekly|IGF-1|14 days|BEO|ANOVA|C.I.|95%|BEO|BEO|0.05|0.001|0.05|between week|0.001|0.05|BEO|BEO","biorxiv","","","","PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","biorxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.17.995209","biorxiv_medrxiv"

"Robert J Hardwick; Marleen Werkman; James E Truscott; Roy M Anderson","Stochastic challenges to interrupting helminth transmission","Predicting the effect of different programmes designed to control both the morbidity induced by helminth infections and parasite transmission is greatly facilitated by the use of mathematical models of transmission and control impact. In such models, it is essential to account for as many sources of uncertainty -- natural, or otherwise -- to ensure robustness in prediction and to accurately depict variation around an expected outcome. In this paper, we investigate how well the standard deterministic models match the predictions made using individual-based stochastic simulations. We also explore how well concepts which derive from deterministic models, such as ‘breakpoints’ in transmission, apply in the stochastic world. Employing an individual based stochastic model framework we also investigate how transmission and control are affected by the migration of infected people into a defined community. To give our study focus we consider the control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) by mass drug administration (MDA), though our methodology is readily applicable to the other helminth species such as the schistosome parasites and the filarial worms. We show it is possible to define a ‘stochastic breakpoint’ where much noise surrounds the expected deterministic breakpoint. We also discuss the concept of the ‘interruption of transmission’ independent of the ‘breakpoint’ concept where analyses of model behaviour illustrate the current limitations of deterministic models to account for the ‘fade-out’ or transmission extinction behaviour in simulations. The analyses based on migration confirm a relationship between the infected human migration rate per unit of time and the death rate of infective stages that are released into the free-living environment (eggs or larvae depending on the STH species) that create the reservoir of infection which in turn determines the likelihood that control activities aim at chemotherapeutic treatment of the human host will eliminate transmission. The development of a new stochastic simulation code for STH in the form of a publicly-available open-source python package which includes features to incorporate many population stratifications, different control interventions including mass drug administration (with defined frequency, coverage levels and compliance patterns) and inter-village human migration is also described.","b0899a264af548a89d649154aec569889717b295","True","","helminth|MDA|helminth|STH|STH","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|NORP|PERSON","medrxiv","2019-12-18","","10.1101/2019.12.17.19013490","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing. Methods: Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of ten existing pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to "Disease X" (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued. Results: The probability that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 32% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 Jan 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 59%. Conclusions: We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen. The proposed approach, that uses only routinely-observed non-virological data, can aid ongoing risk assessments even before virological test results become available.

Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV in the early stage of epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naive population. As of 24 January 2020, with 23 exported cases, and estimating the growth rate from 8 December 2019 (scenario 1) and using the data since growth of exported cases (scenario 2), the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 5433 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 3883, 7160) and 17780 cases (95% CI: 9646, 28724), respectively. The latest estimates of the cCFR were 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.6) for scenario 1 and 7.7% (95% CI: 4.9-11.3%) for scenario 2, respectively.

Methods: The information of COVID-19 and 2003-SARS from websites of NHCPRC and the World Health Organization was collected, and then the transmission dynamics of the two kinds of infectious diseases were analyzed. The information of 853 confirmed COVID-19 patients obtained from the website of health committees of 18 provinces. A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the COVID-19 epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed COVID-19 case data. Results: The growth rate of new cases and deaths of COVID-19 were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 853 confirmed COVID-19 cases aged 1 months to 94 years and the average age was (45.05 ± 17.22) years.

As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number Ro -- the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of Ro vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of Ro across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate $r$, the mean generation interval $\bar G$, and the generation-interval dispersion $\kappa$. We then apply our framework to early estimates of Ro for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early Ro estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of Ro, including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate Ro at the outset of an epidemic.","0ff4ad5359ee2df3568605385a8616d8da66bf2c","True","","Ro|Ro|Ro|three|r$|\bar|\kappa$.|Ro|Ro|Ro|Ro","medrvix","","","","PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|MONEY|MONEY|MONEY|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON","medrxiv","2020-02-02","","10.1101/2020.01.30.20019877","biorxiv_medrxiv"

"","Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study","Background: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to 46,997 confirmed cases as of 13th February 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually.","a44334e676e43c1889d282b0f0a8365f0f1e0c52","True","","46,997|as of 13th February 2020|Wuhan|Wuhan|January and February 2020|daily|Rt|2.35|95%|CI|1.15-4.77|one week|23rd January|1.05|95%|CI|0.413-2.39|one week|Rt|Wuhan|early January|at least four|more than 50%|COVID-19|Wuhan|late January 2020|Wuhan","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|DATE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-02","","10.1101/2020.01.31.20019901","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to describe the evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission in Guangdong Province. Methods: A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview. Results: A total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan. Conclusions: We observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China.

In addition, we adjusting for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.","a1bff76ce360e8990b0a4ee2a5228a6e6e63d9c1","True","","COVID-19|28|n=28|n=18|4.0 days|95%|3.1|4.9|4.6 days|95%|3.5|5.9|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-13","","10.1101/2020.02.03.20019497","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.","21100aba41a4bfb48d7dc37f1bf5dbb38bf3867a","True","","Human Coronaviruses|HCoVs|CoV|Middle east|2019|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV.|Drug|HCoV|15|HCoV|2019-nCoV|CoV|79.7%|six|HCoVs|2019-nCoV|two|96%|89.6%|SARS-CoV.

Using an SEIR-type transmission model, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by one-time vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients within 24 hours of symptom onset (assuming 10% asymptomatic transmission).

We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.","b51d1c7287ac75790a52752489577d33d522898b","True","","2019|Novel Coronavirus|2019-nCoV|Wuhan City|China|three|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|RNA|RNA|2019-nCoV","medrvix","","","","DATE|PERSON|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-11","","10.1101/2020.02.03.20020289","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Based on the cumulative Baidu migration index (CBMI), we first analyzed the proportion of Wuhan's migrant population to other cities. Our results confirm that there is a significant correlation between the export population of Wuhan and reported cases in various regions.

For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. As data become available, we subsequently analyzed them during three consecutive periods obtaining a sequence of model predictions. All available data up were processed the same way. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data. Using this model and the three sets of data, we estimated maximum cases as about 21,000, 28,000 and 35,000 cases refining these predictions in near-real time. With slightly different approach (linearization in time) the estimate of maximum cases was even higher (about 65,000). Although the estimates of maximum cases increase as more data were reported all models show reaching a peak in mid-February in contrast to the unconfined exponential growth.

Aim: We aimed to estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January through to April, 2020. Methods: A series of domestic and international travel network-based connectivity and risk analyses were performed, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of Wuhan. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent. Conclusion: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.","013d9d1cba8a54d5d3718c229b812d7cf91b6c89","True","","2019-nCoV|Wuhan City|China|the end of 2019|a Public Health Emergency|International Concern|the World Health Organization|January 30, 2020|Wuhan|2019-nCoV|China|January through to April, 2020|Wuhan|Lunar New Year|LNY|China|59,912|834|95%|478|2019-nCoV|Wuhan|382|China|the two weeks|Wuhan|Asia|Europe|US|Australia|3.3 million|75%|China|the following three months of February to April, 2020|2019-nCoV|China|2019-nCoV","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|EVENT|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|LOC|LOC|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-05","","10.1101/2020.02.04.20020479","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia and Europe, and we investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.","136ee862ad53b606c8f2bea917b9705f5079e88e","True","","China|China|China|Rloc|China|Rloc|Rloc|Rloc|America|Asia|Europe|China","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|LOC|LOC|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-05","","10.1101/2020.02.04.20020503","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.","59eab95c43fdea01481fdbf9bae45dfe28ffc693","True","","2019-nCov|2019-nCov|five|two|Asian|Caucasian|60|60|Asian|Caucasian|ACE2|2019-nCov","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-11","","10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.","f5d9ab798adf8face1655d476644ebb75fbfef18","True","","2019|2019-nCoV|first|Wuhan|Hubei Province|China|December 2019|Angiotensin|CoV|2019-nCoV.|RNA|2019-nCoV","medrvix","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-07","","10.1101/2020.02.05.20020545","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The management and control of 2019-nCoV introductions heavily relies on the public health capacity of a country. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively. Interpretation: Several countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with 2019-nCoV importations. Resources and intensified surveillance and capacity capacity should be urgently prioritized towards countries at moderate risk that may be ill-prepared to face the importation and to limit onward transmission.","8762adc9311e5803d1de438493772269acfe7fa3","True","","2019-nCoV|23|China|7|African|2019-nCoV|African|2019-nCoV.|China|Africa|two|the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework|the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index|Chinese|Egypt|Algeria|Republic of South Africa|Nigeria|Ethiopia|Sudan|Angola|Tanzania|Ghana|Kenya|Three|Guangdong|Fujian|Beijing|Africa|2019-nCoV","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|GPE|LOC|CARDINAL|ORG|LAW|NORP|GPE|GPE|LOC|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|LOC|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-07","","10.1101/2020.02.05.20020792","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Qingyuan Zhao; Yang Chen; Dylan S Small","Analysis of the epidemic growth of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak using internationally confirmed cases","Background: On January 23, 2020, a quarantine was imposed on travel in and out of Wuhan, where the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak originated from. Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China. Methods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification. Results: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days--4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4--9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification. Conclusions: Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.","c85f571a674c7fed0ccb9176e9cf9f3d3659ca32","True","","January 23, 2020|Wuhan|2019|2019-nCoV|Wuhan|China|46|Wuhan|January 23|Hong Kong|Japan|Korea|Macau|Singapore|Taiwan|February 5, 2020|January 23|Bayesian|every 2.9 days|95%|2 days--4.1 days|2019-nCoV|5.7|95%|3.4|the last 3 days|January 23|Wuhan|2019-nCoV","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|NORP|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-09","","10.1101/2020.02.06.20020941","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P<0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.","dfb0fedbeed56bd2b795a67faab28295afc14c96","True","","December 2019|2019|2019-nCoV|Wuhan|China|1,099|2019-nCoV|552|31|January 29th, 2020|47.0 years|41.90%|Only 1.18%|31.30%|Wuhan|71.80%|Wuhan|Fever|87.9%|67.7%|Diarrhea|3.0 days|0 to 24.0 days|50.00%|23.87%|5.20%|Lymphopenia|82.1%|55|5.00%|15|1.36%|9.80|95%|4.06|23.67|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV","medrvix","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-09","","10.1101/2020.02.06.20020974","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.","2cc809ed4d5c3640ee2351fdb1876e8ff6c01b51","True","","2019-nCoV.

"","Caution on Kidney Dysfunctions of 2019-nCoV Patients","Until 24:00 of February 7th 2020, 31774 laboratory-confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection have been reported, including 6101 severe cases in critical conditions and 722 deaths. The critical and urgent need at this moment is to find an effective treatment strategy with available means to prevent these thousands of severe inpatients from worsening and dying. It has been recently known that the 2019-nCoV shares a common cellular mechanism with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Thus, we surveyed a previous retrospective case study on SARS which showed that acute renal impairment was uncommon in SARS but carried a formidably high mortality (91.7%, 33 of 36 cases). Here we report an ongoing case study on kidney functions in 59 patients infected by 2019-nCoV (including 28 diagnosed as severe cases and 3 deaths). 63% (32/51) of the patients exhibited proteinuria, indicative of renal impairment. 19% (11/59) and 27% (16/59) of the patients had an elevated level of plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen respectively. The computerized tomography (CT) scan showed radiographic abnormalities of the kidneys in 100% (27/27) of the patients. Together, these multiple lines of evidence point to the idea that renal impairment is common in 2019-nCov patients, which may be one of the major causes of the illness by the virus infection and also may contribute to multi-organ failure and death eventually. Therefore, we strongly suggest exercising a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of 2019-nCoV patients and, very importantly, that applying potential interventions including continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for protecting kidney functions as early as possible, particular for those with plasma creatinine rising, is key to preventing fatality.","","False","","24:00 of February 7th 2020|31774|2019-nCoV|6101|722|thousands|2019-nCoV|CoV|91.7%|33|36|59|2019-nCoV|28|3|63%|32/51|19%|11/59|27%|16/59|CT|100%|2019-nCov|2019-nCoV|CRRT","medrvix","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|NORP|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-12","","10.1101/2020.02.08.20021212","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days.

While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States, which would allow endemic transmission. As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission.

The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.","5c31897d01f3edc7f58a0f03fceec2373fcfdc3d","True","","2019-nCoV|Mainland China|Wuhan|7.5 days|2.4|90%|CI|2.2-2.6|January 23, 2020|58,956|90%|40,759 - 87,471|Wuhan|3,491|90%|1,924 - 7,360|Mainland China|January 23|Chinese|only 3 to 5 days|80%|the end of February|Modeling|90%|Mainland China|50%","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|LOC|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|LOC|DATE|NORP|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|LOC|PERCENT","medrxiv","2020-02-11","","10.1101/2020.02.09.20021261","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020. We used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming. We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. Under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21. This date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work resuming. Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three scenarios. The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days.","2913d91f13fd59c698f68ba63008d8e0550c0607","True","","February 11, 2020|China|2019|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|the next 30 days|three|China|Wuhan|Wuhan|February 10, 2020|February 11, 2020|March 12, 2020|China|72172|54348|149774|March 12, 2020|daily|February 21|February 14|February 26|Except Wuhan|March 12|95.4%|100%|75.7%|the end of February|three|the next 30 days","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|DATE|GPE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|ORG|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-11","","10.1101/2020.02.09.20021360","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 6±10 in Wuhan and March 20±16 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave.

The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. According to the spread characters of 2019-nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model. This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported official data, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared.","815745bf1b522d33fd7371cc9a6561a2a93ef87e","True","","Chinese|2019-nCoV|Jan.23|2020|SEIR|Exposed|EIR|2019-nCov|EIR|two|2019-nCov|2019-nCov|2019-nCov","medrvix","","","","NORP|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-12","","10.1101/2020.02.10.20021519","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia.

Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a c-index of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the NLR had superior standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of severe illness was 9.1% in age ≥ 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients, and half of patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 would develop severe illness. Based on the risk stratification of NLR with age, the study developed a 2019-nCoV pneumonia management process. Conclusions: The NLR was the early identification of risk factors for 2019-nCoV severe illness.

"Laurent Hébert-Dufresne; Benjamin M. Althouse; Samuel V. Scarpino; Antoine Allard","Beyond R0: the importance of contact tracing when predicting epidemics","The basic reproductive number --- R0 --- is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Nevertheless, estimating R0 for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R0. Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of R0 and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R0) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R0 when predicting epidemic size.","06c1b3535b83251cf92c01258b5048beeab7a460","True","","two|R0|secondary|first|secondary|secondary|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|5-40%","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT","medrxiv","2020-02-12","","10.1101/2020.02.10.20021725","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Yongdao Zhou; Jianghu Dong","Statistical Inference for Coronavirus Infected Patients in Wuhan","Importance: The new coronavirus outbreak has seriously affected the quality of life in China. Wuhan is the disaster area, where the number of cases has increased rapidly. However, the current measures of infected patients in Wuhan are still underestimated. Objective: To estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan from several sampled data. The correct estimated infected patients can be helpful for the government to arrange the needed beds in hospital wards to meet the actual needs. Design: We proposed to use the sampling survey to estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan. The sampling survey is a kind of non-comprehensive survey. It selected some units from all the survey objects to carry out the survey and made the estimation and inference to all the survey objects. Sampling surveys can obtain information that reflects the overall situation, although it is not a comprehensive survey. Setting: We estimated the overall infection rate in Wenzhou city, which has a better data collection system. Simultaneously, another different samples of Wuhan tourists to Singapore will be used to validate the infection rate in Wenzhou city. Combined these two samples, we give the estimation of the number of infected patients in Wuhan and other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province. Participants: The number of people who returned from Wuhan to Wenzhou was selected from the daily notification of the pneumonia epidemic caused by a new coronavirus infection in the city. Exposures for observational studies: The daily rate of the pneumonia epidemic caused by the new coronavirus infection in Wenzhou City. The numerator is the number of people diagnosed and whether each person diagnosed had a history of living in Wuhan. The denominator is the total number of people returning to Wenzhou from Wuhan. Based on this rate, it is reasonable to predict the number of the infected patients.","","False","","China|Wuhan|Wuhan|Wuhan|Wuhan|Wenzhou|Wuhan|Singapore|Wenzhou|two|Wuhan|Hubei Province|Wuhan|Wenzhou|daily|daily|Wenzhou City|Wuhan|Wenzhou|Wuhan","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-12","","10.1101/2020.02.10.20021774","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. METHODS: The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number. FINDINGS: The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. INTERPRETATION: Population emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.","eec5b4ce2de8d9d00be664e6af79cac476991bbf","True","","2019-nCoV|China|Five millions|Wuhan|Wuhan|2019-nCoV|January 30, 2020|WinBUGS|Wuhan City|Hubei|Baidu Qianxi|2019-nCoV|Hubei|South China|Sichuan|Yunnan|Hubei|Wuhan|Hubei|Wuhan|Lockdown|19|Hubei|Wuhan|Spring Festival","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|LOC|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|EVENT","medrxiv","2020-02-12","","10.1101/2020.02.10.20021824","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups were analyzed. Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6 and IL-10. Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in severe patients.

We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies in China could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of April. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries.","2cfe7a4cc1fceed0ad7ffbd6244a61e0b2c3ac8b","True","","first|China|Chinese|three|late-December 2019|late-April 2020|COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei|China|China|COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei|China|China|5 days|853 million|30|42.7|the end of April|COVID-19|China","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|GPE|NORP|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-12","","10.1101/2020.02.11.20020735","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. Finding: Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected ≥ 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected ≥ 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral RNAs could be detected in all the lower respiratory tract of severe cases, but not the mild cases. CT scan of cases 02, 07 and 13 showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass opacity, while no viral RNAs were detected in first three or all the upper respiratory samples. Interpretation: Sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases. CT scan could serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was initiated to investigate the possible transmission of 2019−nCoV through aerosol contact with conjunctiva. We enrolled 67 cases of confirmed or suspected cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) during 17−28 Jan 2020. Nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were collected for real time RT-PCR analysis to detect 2019−nCoV. Results: 63 patients were identified as laboratory−confirmed NCP and the remaining four were suspected NCP. Conjunctival swab samples from one NCP patient yielded positive PCR results and two NCP patients yielded probable positive PCR results. None of the three patients had ocular symptoms. The only one NCP patient with conjunctivitis as the first symptom had negative conjunctival sac 2019−nCoV test. Conjunctival swab samples from the four suspected cases of NCIP were negative. Conclusion: 2019−nCoV can be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients with NCP. Through clinical analysis, viral transmission via the conjunctival route was not supported by the data. Good clinical protection can effectively cut off the transmission path.","","False","","2019|2019−nCoV|2019−nCoV|67|NCP|17−28 Jan 2020|Nasopharyngeal|RT-PCR|2019−nCoV.|63|NCP|four|NCP|one|NCP|two|NCP|three|one|NCP|first|2019−nCoV|four|NCP","medrvix","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-12","","10.1101/2020.02.11.20021956","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ~4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ~3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be ~2.6 based on confirmed cases and ~2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around 0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.","","False","","first|disease-2019|COVID-19|December 1st, 2019|Wuhan|Hubei Province|China|40,235|909|China|February 10, 2020|Hubei|China|January 11 to February 10, 2020|90%|Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead|R0|SIRD|three weeks ahead|February 29|twenty|forty|R0|11th|January|the 18th of January|~4.6|one|second|SIRD|R0|second|China|180,000|45,000|February 29|10th|February|2,700|February 29|January 26|Hubei|China|twenty|forty|around 0.15%|Hubei|the end of February","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|PERSON|ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|WORK_OF_ART|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-13","","10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186",""

WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells.

During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus-specific IgG play important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS-like coronavirus. METHODS: A long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, as a diagnostic antigen. RESULTS: Anti SARS-CoV IgG was found to persist for up to 12 years. IgG titers typically peaked in 2004, declining rapidly from 2004-2006, and then continued to decline at a slower rate. IgG titers in SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers remained at a significantly high level until 2015. Patients treated with corticosteroids at the time of infection were found to have lower IgG titers than those without. CONCLUSIONS: IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can persist for at least 12 years. The presence of SARS-CoV IgG might provide protection against SARS-CoV and other betacoronavirus. This study provides valuable information regarding humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV and the 2019-nCoV.","d3c2e2839498c613ee95739dce7052109750362c","True","","2019-nCoV|17 years ago|the 2002-2003|IgG|IgG|METHODS|34|CoV|2002-2003|Guangzhou|China|2003-2015|Twenty|CoV|40|2015|IgG|ELISA|CoV|up to 12 years|IgG|2004|2004-2006|IgG|2015|IgG|IgG|CoV|at least 12 years|IgG|CoV|CoV|2019-nCoV.","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|DATE|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|NORP|PERSON|DATE|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-14","","10.1101/2020.02.12.20021386","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Igor Nesteruk","Statistics based predictions of coronavirus 2019-nCoV spreading in mainland China","Background. The epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented. Objective. Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time. Methods. In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989. Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted. Conclusions. Simple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV in mainland China. The further research should focus on updating the predictions with the use of fresh data and using more complicated mathematical models.","d34a47b592e9c6e84b5b4115474349acbc0fb925","True","","2019-nCoV|China|SIR|Chernivtsi|Ukraine|1988-1989|SIR|2019-nCoV|China","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-13","","10.1101/2020.02.12.20021931","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Meanwhile, NCP rapidly spread from China to other countries, and several countries' government rush to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. We analyzed the infection rate of the evacuees and extrapolated the results in Wuhan's NCP incidence estimation. Methods: We collected the total number and confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection in the evacuation of Korea, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and France and estimated the infection rate of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) among people who were evacuated from Wuhan with a meta-analysis. NCP incidence of Wuhan was indirectly estimated based on data of evacuation. Results: From Jan 29 to Feb 2, 2020, 1916 people have been evacuated from Wuhan, among them 17 have been confirmed 2019-nCov infected. The infection rate is estimated to be 1.1% (95% CI 0.4%-3.1%) using one group meta-analysis method with random effect model. We then estimated that almost 110,000 (95% CI: 40,000-310,000) people were infected with 2019-nCov in Wuhan around Feb 2, 2020, assuming the infection risk of evacuees is close to Chinese citizens in Wuhan. Conclusions: At the beginning of the outbreak, incidence of NCP may be vastly underestimated. Our result emphasizes that 2019-nCov has proposed a huge public health threats in Wuhan. We need to respond more rapidly, take large-scale public health interventions and draconian measures to limiting population mobility and control the epidemic.","5585d267f9b505b068f9f72bff5f12c248472f0a","True","","late December 2019|NCP|Wuhan|Hubei|China|NCP|China|Wuhan|Wuhan|NCP|2019-nCov|Korea|Japan|Germany|Singapore|France|2019|2019-nCov|Wuhan|NCP|Wuhan|Jan 29 to Feb 2, 2020,|1916|Wuhan|17|2019-nCov|1.1%|95%|CI|0.4%-3.1%|one|almost 110,000|95%|CI|40,000-310,000|2019-nCov|Wuhan|Feb 2, 2020|Chinese|Wuhan|NCP|2019-nCov|Wuhan","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|NORP|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-13","","10.1101/2020.02.12.20022285","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Sample types, interpretation methods, and corresponding laboratory standards must be established. The possibility of other infections should be assessed to provide a basis for clinical classification, isolation, and treatment. Accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated the testing methods for 2019-nCoV and co-infections. Methods: We used a fluorescence-based quantitative PCR kit urgently distributed by the Chinese CDC to detect 8274 close contacts in the Wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-nCoV genome. We also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens; 316 subjects were also tested for 2019-nCoV. Findings: Among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-nCoV infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed negative results in the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test (non-019-nCoV); and 252 cases (3.0%) because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. Sixteen patients who originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 14 patients (87.5%) were finally defined as 2019-nCoV-positive, and 2 (12.5%) were finally defined as negative. The positive rates of nCoV-NP and nCovORF1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. nCoV-NP-positive only and nCovORF1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. In the 316 patients with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-nCov and 6/104 had co-infection with coronavirus (3/104), influenza A virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza A H3N2 (1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza A virus (11/202), influenza A H3N2 (11/202), rhinovirus (10/202), respiratory syncytial virus (7/202), influenza B virus (6/202), metapneumovirus (4/202), and coronavirus (2/202). Interpretation: Clinical testing methods for 2019-nCoV require improvement. Importantly, 5.8% of 2019-nCoV infected and 18.4% of non-2019-nCoV-infected patients had other pathogen infections. It is important to treat combined infections and perform rapid screening to avoid cross-contamination of patients. A test that quickly and simultaneously screens as many pathogens as possible is needed.","","False","","2019-Novel|2019-nCoV|thousands|2019-nCoV|Chinese|CDC|8274|Wuhan|two|2019-nCoV|613|13|316|2019-nCoV.|Findings|2745|33.2%|2019-nCoV|5277|63.8%|2019-nCoV|252|3.0%|only one|Sixteen|only one|a few days later|14|87.5%|2019-nCoV|2|12.5%|nCoV-NP|34.7%|34.7%|NP|nCovORF1ab|1.5%|1.5%|316|104|2019-nCov|6/104|3/104|2/104|2/104|1/104|212|11/202|11/202|10/202|7/202|6/202|4/202|2/202|2019-nCoV|5.8%|2019-nCoV|18.4%","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT","medrxiv","2020-02-13","","10.1101/2020.02.12.20022327","biorxiv_medrxiv"

ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients' fertility.","c672f5b0d7c0a40f7cc1bdf079066d72eb8f64ec","True","","December 2019|January 2020|2019-nCoV|Wuhan|Angiotensin|2019-nCoV|Leydig|2019-nCoV","medrvix","","","","DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-13","","10.1101/2020.02.12.20022418","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"","Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2","Background: We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% & 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. Results: Under baseline assumptions exit and entry screening combined with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by at least 83 (75% of simulations: at least 36, 97.5% 8) days while there is no more than 1 infected traveller per week. The benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by at least 76 (75%: 33, 97.5%: 7) days. With increasing rates of infected travellers, less effective sensitisation or without screening these delays shrink rapidly to a week or less. Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination could delay outbreaks in yet unaffected countries and support local containment efforts, but only if infected traveller numbers are very low.","11f96d05db6854ef95312aa3a4736724ce1f02d6","True","","COVID-2019-like|50%|75%|97.5%|at least 83|75%|at least 36|97.5%|8) days|no more than 1|at least 76|75%|33|97.5%|7) days|week","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-13","","10.1101/2020.02.12.20022426","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. Methods: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis. Results: Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 reached values as high as 5.20 (95%CrI: 5.04-5.47) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 was associated with a declined R at 0.58 (95%CrI: 0.51-0.64), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 1905526 (95%CrI: 1350283-2655936) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95%CrI: 13.5-26.6%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.04% (95% CrI: 0.03-0.06%) and 0.12% (95%CrI: 0.08-0.17%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.19% Conclusions: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China during January-February, 2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.","","False","","Wuhan City|China|December, 2019|2019|COVID-19|China|109|March 10th|COVID-19|Wuhan City|China|daily|Wuhan City|Japanese|Wuhan City|Wuhan City|China|2019-2020|as high as 5.20|5.04|January 23rd in 2020|0.58|95%CrI|0.51-0.64|1905526|95%CrI|1350283-2655936|Wuhan City|19.1%|95%CrI|13.5-26.6%|IFR|IFR|0.04%|95%|0.03-0.06%|0.12%|0.08-0.17%|CFR|4.19%|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|January-February, 2020","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|NORP|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|MONEY|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-13","","10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434",""

Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.","90b5ecf991032f3918ad43b252e17d1171b4ea63","True","","Wuhan|Hubei Province|China|December 2019|over 40,000|humid|COVID-19|COVID-19|China|summer months|the North Hemisphere|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|GPE|DATE|LOC|PERSON","medrxiv","2020-02-17","","10.1101/2020.02.12.20022467","biorxiv_medrxiv"

As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. Discussion: We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning.","05d99c07db59b6948e39bfa62c2cbbf62944059a","True","","CoVID-19|first|China|31 December 2019|9 February 2020|25|England|CoVID-19|England|Wales|2011|China|CoVID-19|126 to 147 days|months|England|Wales|February|June|10 days|78 days|241 days|Seasonal|CoVID-19|England|Wales|winter months","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|ORG|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-14","","10.1101/2020.02.12.20022566","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Characterising the dynamics of transmission is essential for identifying which individuals and regions might be most at risk. As data from detailed contact tracing investigations are not available in many settings, we combined age, location, genotype, and onset date of cases in order to probabilistically reconstruct the importation status and transmission clusters within a newly developed R package called o2geosocial. We compared our inferred cluster size distributions to 737 transmission clusters identified through detailed contact-tracing in the United States between 2001 and 2016. We were able to reconstruct the importation status of the cases and found good agreement between the inferred and reference clusters. The results were improved when the contact-tracing investigations were used to set the importation status before running the model. Spatial heterogeneity in vaccine coverage is difficult to measure directly. Our approach was able to highlight areas with potential for local transmission using a minimal number of variables and could be applied to assess the intensity of ongoing transmission in a region.","38bab3f17b186bd8ee289e5d135bb7d500ef500b","True","","737|the United States|between 2001 and 2016","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-15","","10.1101/2020.02.13.20020891","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients. We identified 11 of 20 co-infections in NCP cases, including regular respiratory virus, fungi and bacteria synchronously. Genomic analysis showed that 8 of 10 cases had no mutation in virus genome, while 2 cases had only one single mutation in N gene. Our study discovered that a combination of chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and multi-plex PCR is recommended in regions outside Hubei province. Co-infection of other pathogens with SARS-CoV-2 exists and should be acknowledged. Repeated sampling, change of specimen type or metagenomics sequencing could further facilitate during critical clinical cases.","8b71ce92ec03e066eca7792bfd17e2f210d50ce3","True","","Wuhan|Hubei|December 2019|China|Hubei|NCP|NCP|January 22nd to February 9th, 2020|Eastern China|Nasopharyngeal|CT|Pathogen|RT-PCR|53|NCP|20|Fourteen|70%|3 (15%|first|second|RT-PCR|NCP|NCP|11|20|NCP|8|10|2|only one|CT|RT-PCR|Hubei","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|DATE|LOC|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-17","","10.1101/2020.02.13.20022673","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Rene Niehus; Pablo M De Salazar; Aimee Taylor; Marc Lipsitch","Quantifying bias of COVID-19 prevalence and severity estimates in Wuhan, China that depend on reported cases in international travelers","Risk of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore′s capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.","adb3a6501ad731eda95d0a1a182a793a0dcd58b0","True","","Wuhan|Singapore|COVID-19|Bayesian|Singapore|38%|95%|HPDI 22% - 64|Singapore′s|2.8|95%|Singapore|second|the Global Health Security|Singapore|40%|95%|HPDI 22% - 67%|37%|95%|HPDI 18% - 68%|11%|95%|HPDI 0% - 42%|Wuhan|Wuhan","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|ORG|NORP|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|ORDINAL|FAC|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-14","","10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources. Results: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end. Conclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.","","False","","2019-nCoV|Wuhan|2019|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|China|2003|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|13-24 degree Celsius|19 degree Celsius|about 60 days|50%-80%|about 75%|30 mm/ month|one week|China|13-18 degree Celsius|Beijing|Tianjin|Hebei|Jiangsu|Zhejiang|Shanghai|May 2020|Beijing|Tianjin|China|Zhengzhou|Wuhan|Jiangsu|Zhejiang|Shanghai|Pearl River Delta|24 degree Celsius|2019-nCoV.|The coming of spring|Wuhan|China|Pearl River Delta|China|24 degree|Celsius|2019-nCoV|June","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|QUANTITY|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|GPE|QUANTITY|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|LOC|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|LOC|GPE|QUANTITY|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-18","","10.1101/2020.02.13.20022715","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","1218f278a4f8d83dac14b23c8f698062812ef9d5","True","","first|Wuhan|China|December 2019|more than 80,000|2,700|Feb 27, 2020|four|229E|HKU1|OC43|early 2020|the Northern Hemisphere|winter 2020/2021|seasonal|Seasonal|seasonal","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|LOC|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-17","","10.1101/2020.02.13.20022806","biorxiv_medrxiv"

To facilitate triage or identification of the large number of COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms in designated fever clinics, we set to identify a practical marker that could be conveniently utilized by first-line health-care workers in clinics. To do so, we performed a case-control study by analyzing clinical and laboratory findings between PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=52) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (n=53). The patients in two cohorts all had similar symptoms, mainly fever and respiratory symptoms. The rates of patients with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) or lymphopenia (two parameters suggested by current National and WHO COVID-19 guidelines) had no differences between these two cohorts, while the rate of eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (79%) was much higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (36%). When the symptoms were combined with eosinopenia, this combination led to a diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 64%, respectively, much higher than 48% and 53% when symptoms were combined with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) and/ or lymphopenia. Thus, our analysis reveals that eosinopenia may be a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor for SARS-CoV-2 infection than leukocyte counts and lymphopenia recommended by the current guidelines.","47b07518dc0f608e53198bb5f8a95caa1c164fe5","True","","COVID-19|Wuhan|China|40000|COVID-19|first|n=53|two|two|National|WHO|two|79%|36%|79%|64%|48%|53%","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT","medrxiv","2020-02-17","","10.1101/2020.02.13.20022830","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Although this risky pneumonia with high infection rates and high mortality rates need to be resolved immediately, major gaps in our knowledge of clinical characters of it were still not be established. The aim of this study is to summaries and analysis the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Methods: Literature have been systematically performed a search on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, GreyNet International, and The Cochrane Library from inception up to February 8, 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess quality, and publication bias was analyzed by Egger test. In the single-arm meta-analysis, A fix-effects model was used to obtain a pooled incidence rate. We conducted subgroup analysis according to geographic region and research scale. Results: A total of nine studies including 356 patients were included in this study, the mean age was 52.4 years and 221 (62.1%) were male. The pooled incidences rate of symptoms as follows: pharyngalgia (12.2%, 95% CI: 0.087-0.167), diarrhea (9.2%, 95% CI: 0.062-0.133) and headache (8.9%, 95% CI: 0.063-0.125). Meanwhile, 5.7% (95% CI: 0.027-0.114) of patients were found without any symptoms although they were diagnosed by RT-PCR. In the terms of CT imaging examination, the most of patients showed bilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity, 8.6% (95% CI: 0.048-0.148) of patients with crazy-paving pattern, and 11.5% (95% CI: 0.064-0.197) of patients without obvious CT imaging presentations. The pooled incidence of mortality was 8.9% (95% CI: 0.062-0.126).

The quarantine and traffic blockage can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections, henceforth evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine. Method: We collected confirmed case data and the migration data, and introduced the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor to the Flow-SEIR model. By varying the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor, we simulated the change of the peak number and arrival time of infections, then the efficacy of these two intervation measures can be analyzed in our simulation. In our study, the self-protection at home is also included in quarantine. Results: In the simulated results, the quarantine and traffic blockage are effective for epidemic control. For Hubei province, the current quarantine factor is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who had flowed out from Hubei. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26. With the quarantine and traffic blockage factor increasing, the number of infections decrease dramatically. We also simulated the start dates of quarantine and traffic blockage at four time points, the simulated results show that the early of warning is also effective for epidemic containing. However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of infections. In general, the quarantine is much more effective than the traffic blockage control. Conclusion: Both of quarantine and traffic blockage are effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19. However, the eff icacy of quarantine is found to be much stronger than that of traffic blockage. Considering traffic blockage may also cause huge losses of economy, we propose to gradually deregulate the traffic blockage, and improve quarantine instead. Also, there might be a large number of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19, the quarantine should be continued for a long time until the epidemic is totally under control.","b1b9d81726e56c2781ce6b63ae5015cf2f314c6f","True","","2019-nCoV|Wuhan|China|every day|Method|two|Hubei|0.405|around 40.5%|0.66|around 34%|Hubei|Hubei|0.285|0.26|four|21.06% - 22.38%|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-17","","10.1101/2020.02.14.20022913","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current UK definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate that any definition where close contact requires more than 4 hours of contact is likely to lead to uncontrolled spread.","f7891683eecd12b3908862fc7ef1d341ca7a293c","True","","Coronavirus|China|the United Kingdom|UK|2 meters for 15 minutes or more|less than 1|5|36.1|95th|0-182|more than 4 hours","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|TIME","medrxiv","2020-02-17","","10.1101/2020.02.14.20023036","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection. Methods Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. Results We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably. Conclusions A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission.

"Guopeng ZHOU; Chunhua CHI","A model simulation study on effects of intervention measures in Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic","Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 ± 1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 ± 559099.9 by the end of period 2 (day70) in free transmission state. And at day90, total patients number is 913396.5 ± 559099.9. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. This will put great burden on the shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectious disease.","57e01ad2a4961cd5cc6a3733f5f8c013a8946f3c","True","","the beginning of January 2020|Wuhan|China|WHO|Wuhan|Method|3|7.5days|3|50|141427709|the end of period 1|2868.7 ± 1739.0|913396.5 ± 559099.9|the end of period 2|913396.5 ± 559099.9|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|MONEY|MONEY|DATE|MONEY|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-18","","10.1101/2020.02.14.20023168","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Individuals from the country at risk of COVID-19 infection have been included in a home-quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain. Methods: To estimate the possible number of infected individuals within the large influx of international students, we used a deterministic compartmental model for epidemic and perform a simulation-based search of different rates of compliance with home-quarantine. Results: Under the home-quarantine program, the total number of the infected individuals would reach 24-53 from March 17-March 20, 50-86 from March 18-March 16, and 234-343 from March 4-March 23 with the arrival of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 1% of pre-infectious individuals, in Seoul, South Korea, respectively. Our findings indicated when incoming international students showed strict compliance with quarantine, epidemics were less likely to occur in Seoul, South Korea. Conclusion: To mitigate possible epidemics, additional efforts to improve the compliance of home-quarantine are warranted along with other containment policies.","","False","","March 2020|37,000|Seoul|South Korea|COVID-19|24-53|March 17-March 20|50-86|March 18-March 16|234|March 4-March 23|0.1%|0.2%|1%|Seoul|South Korea|Seoul|South Korea","medrvix","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-19","","10.1101/2020.02.15.20023234","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.

"Can Zhou","Evaluating new evidence in the early dynamics of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China with real time domestic traffic and potential asymptomatic transmissions","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to 28 countries/regions with over 43,000 confirmed cases. Much about this outbreak is still unknown. At this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate alternative sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. With updated real time domestic traffic, this study aims to integrate recent evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 to infer the dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced. The estimated case confirmation rate has been low but has increased steadily to 23.37% on average. The findings of this study depend on the validity of the underlying assumptions, and continuing work is needed, especially in monitoring the current infection status of Wuhan residents.","317943dec06b88c1c62ef0ecd832f0d644b1d417","True","","first|Wuhan|China|December 2019|28|43,000|Wuhan|between Jan. 29|Feb. 2, 2020|COVD-19|Wuhan|SEIR|2.12|95%|2.04|2.18|Wuhan|23.37%|Wuhan","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-18","","10.1101/2020.02.15.20023440","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Its fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS-nCoV, has been reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019-nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets. According to the expression profile of ACE2 in colon epithelial cells, we speculate adenoma and colorectal cancer patients are more likely to be infected with 2019-nCoV than healthy people. Our data may provide a theoretical basis for the classification and management of future 2019-nCoV susceptibility people in clinical application.","73998a3f565b661816d48aa7c20fa5ae617864d5","True","","2019-nCoV|Wuhan|China|December 2019|Feb 2020|China|thousands|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|RNA|ACE2|Asian|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-23","","10.1101/2020.02.15.20023457","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The epidemic in Beijing and Shanghai, Mainland/Hubei and Hubei/Wuhan, are expected to end before the end of February, and before mid- March respectively. The model indicates that, the outbreak in Wuhan is predicted to be ended in the early April. As a result, more effective policies and more efforts on clinical research are demanded. Moreover, through the backtracking simulation, we infer that the outbreak of the epidemic in Mainland/Hubei, Hubei/Wuhan, and Wuhan can be dated back to the end of December 2019 or the beginning of January 2020.","10138816c67a562b55bc9c2b882b62c81fc4b062","True","","2019-nCoV|Herein|01/20|5|Beijing|Shanghai|Mainland/Hubei and Hubei/Wuhan|before the end of February|March|Wuhan|the early April|Mainland/Hubei, Hubei/Wuhan|Wuhan|the end of December 2019|the beginning of January 2020","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|DATE|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|DATE|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-18","","10.1101/2020.02.16.20023465","biorxiv_medrxiv"

It very urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann-function based regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well fitted with the Boltzmann function (R2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) will become minimal between Feb 28 and Mar 10, 2020, with 95% CI. In addition, we found that the data of cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and Worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. To our knowledge this is the first study revealing that the Boltzmann function is suitable to simulate epidemics. The estimated potential total number of confirmed cases and key dates for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak may provide certain guidance for governments, organizations and citizens to optimize preparedness and response efforts.","b117016a887f05386acc4387dab5bf8c769cf90e","True","","2019|Wuhan City|China|China|Boltzmann|Jan 21|Feb 14, 2020|China|Hubei Province|Wuhan City|Boltzmann|R2|0.999|95%|CI|79589|71576|93855|64817|58223|77895|46562|40812|57678|13956|12748|16092|daily|China|Hubei Province|Feb 28|Mar 10, 2020|95%|CI|2003|CoV|China|Boltzmann|first|Boltzmann","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|LOC|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|DATE|PERSON|GPE|LOC|ORDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-18","","10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564","biorxiv_medrxiv"

"Ke Wu; Junhua Zheng; Jian Chen","Utilize State Transition Matrix Model to Predict the Novel Corona Virus Infection Peak and Patient Distribution","Background: Since December 2019, a pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has broken out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public health decision and medical resource allocation in China. We managed to forecast the infection peak time in Hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution. Methods: We used data resource according to cases reported by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in Wuhan on subsequent days. Medical observation, discharge, infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur. Also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. Under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. Results: In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. We are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2/8 data. There should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. Conclusion: We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. Assisting critical care resources in Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend.","d069dfb7f0aefcdc2c890a1bbe773ebd26b01a55","True","","December 2019|2019|2019-nCoV|Wuhan|Hubei|China|China|Hubei|the National Health Commission|the People's Republic of China|Jan 25, 2019,|Feb 28, 2020|Wuhan|Hubei Province|April 6-April 14|between 8300-9800|daily|NCC|-10%|February 23-February|26|6800-7200|1800-2000|daily|NCC|-5%|February 28-March 2|between 7100-7800|1900-2200|daily|NCC|-1%|around the end of March|April 6-April 14|between 8300-9800|2/8|Hubei","medrvix","","","","DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-19","","10.1101/2020.02.16.20023614","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Method: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. Findings: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-γ levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19.

Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (such as school closures, social distancing, or working from home). In addition, they finally provide the possibility to use multiple sources of social mixing data to evaluate the uncertainty that stems from social mixing when designing public health interventions.","6445688d3f59cb7e02f2a8b28450cdf118a8a373","True","","only one|United Kingdom|over 36,000|BBC Pandemic","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-19","","10.1101/2020.02.16.20023754","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Bo Zhang; Hongwei Zhou; Fang Zhou","Study on SARS-COV-2 transmission and the effects of control measures in China","Objective To reconstruct the transmission trajectory of SARS-COV-2 and analyze the effects of control measures in China. Methods Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and a back propagation class to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A limitation factor for the medical resource was imposed to model the infected but not quarantined. Credible data source from Baidu Qianxi were used to assess the number of infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other areas. Results Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 in the very early stage. The true infected number was 4508 in our model in Wuhan before January 22, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan, stage 1), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 1) and 3.3 (China except Hubei, stage 1) to 0.67 (Wuhan, stage 4), 0.83 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 2) and 0.63 (China except Hubei, stage 2), respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073, 21342 and 13384 infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively, and there would be 2179, 633 and 107 death in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively. Conclusion A series of control measures in China have effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19, and the epidemic will end in early April.","","False","","China|SEIR|China|three|Wuhan|Hubei|Wuhan|China|Hubei|Baidu Qianxi|Wuhan|R0|3.6|4508|Wuhan|January 22, 2020|January 22 2020|Wuhan|Hubei|3.6|Wuhan|1),|3.4|Hubei|Wuhan|1|3.3|China|Hubei|1) to 0.67|Wuhan|4|0.83|Hubei|Wuhan|2|0.63|China|Hubei|2|January 23, 2020|Wuhan City|Wuhan|early April|42073|21342|13384|Wuhan|Hubei|Wuhan|China|Hubei|2179|633|107|Wuhan|Hubei|Wuhan|China|Hubei|China|COVID-19|early April","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-18","","10.1101/2020.02.16.20023770","biorxiv_medrxiv"

By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R0=1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47)，TI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200,000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.","e62e453735dc2022f4d81aa9b22769de30d0bb90","True","","2019-nCoV|Wuhan|February 15, 2020|Wuhan|37,914|1123|56.9%|73.7%|China|2019-nCoV|Wuhan|Wuhan|February 12, 2020|SEIR|1.40|14|2.8-3.1|Wuhan|February 19|about 45,000|March|the late March|200,000|early March|the late March","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-18","","10.1101/2020.02.16.20023804","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Anna L. Ziff; Robert M. Ziff","Fractal kinetics of COVID-19 pandemic","We give an update to the original paper posted on 2/17/20 -- now (as of 3/1/20) the China deaths are rapidly decreasing, and we find an exponential decline to the power law similar to the that predicted by the network model of \citet{vazquez_polynomial_2006}. At the same time, we see non-China deaths increasing rapidly, and similar to the early behavior of the China statistics. Thus, we see three stages of the spread of the disease in terms of number of deaths: exponential growth, power-law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate. (Original abstract) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to grow rapidly in China and is spreading in other parts of the world. The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models. Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.","33bd85ea9ca61c4d0674c43ae5b901b271b46f1e","True","","2/17/20|3/1/20|China|China|China|three|daily|China|One|SEIR","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-20","","10.1101/2020.02.16.20023820","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods and findings We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%.

To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases. Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/L) than moderate cases (11000 million/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4 U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). IL-2R, TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6 pg/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/L). The expressions of IFN-γ by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%). Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-γ production, which may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19.","d4cfb1fc4fc53abbc1d4b0ca60276c6af6632c3c","True","","late December, 2019|2|Wuhan|China|Coronavirus Disease 2019|COVID-19|21|Wuhan Tongji|Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020|between 11|21|COVID-19|4|19%|Huanan|7|33.3%|63.9|51.4 years|10|90.9%|7 (|70.0%|100%|100%|70%|90%|100%|70%|50%|30%|122.9|366.2|Lymphocyte|7000 million/L|11000 million/L|41.4 U/L|567.2|U/L|135.2|1734.4|17.6 U/L|234.4|U/L|51.4|880.2|TNF-α|IL-10|1202.4|10.9|10.9|7.5|6.6|CD8+T|332.5|185.6|124.3 million|676.5|359.2|272.0 million|IFN-γ|14.6%|23.6%|IFN-γ|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-19","","10.1101/2020.02.16.20023903","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic. Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 1 March 2020. Competing risk model was used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR was estimated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. Results: As of 1 March 2020, totally 80,369 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The CFR of COVID-19 were estimated to be 70.9% (95% CI: 66.8%-75.6%) during Jan 20-Feb 2, 20.2% (18.6%-22.1%) during Feb 3-14, 6.9% (6.4%-7.4%) during Feb 15-23, 1.5% (1.4%-1.6%) during Feb 24-March 1 in Hubei province, and 20.3% (17.0%-25.3%) during Jan 20-28, 1.9% (1.8%-2.1%) during Jan 29-Feb 12, 0.9% (0.8%-1.1%) during Feb 13-18, 0.4% (0.4%-0.5%) during Feb 19-March 1 in other areas of China, respectively. Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China, over 3 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time.","","False","","COVID-19|2|Wuhan|China|late December 2019|CFR|CFR|COVID-19|daily|the National Health Commission|P.

Judged from the number of confirmed cases of NCP, controlling the outbreak in China mainland is to control the epidemic in Hubei province, and the key to controlling the outbreak in Hubei province is to control the epidemic in Wuhan city; Judging from the gradual increase in the number and cure rate of the NCP, and the gradual decline in the number of deaths and mortality, the trend of outbreak control and treatment is getting better; A decrease of the NCP spread index indicates a slowdown in the spread of the virus, but the cumulative confirmed cases is still increase, so the epidemic will continue for some time. However, the turning point of the epidemic in mainland China has not yet occurred. On February 12, 2020, the turning point of the epidemic in China mainland except Hubei province, has turned up.","dac1b1607ae72b9509ab26367e0d55016e8132a8","True","","China|December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020|Analysis|66,492|NCP|China|December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020|66,492|NCP|China|54,406|Hubei Province|37,914|Wuhan|February 5, 2020|NCP|China|5,328|February 4, 2020|China|February 12, 2020|NCP|China|15,152|February 3, 2020|Hubei Province|China|NCP|December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020|1,523|NCP|China|8096|2.29%|1523/66492|12.18%|8096/66492|January 27, 2020|NCP|NCP|January 29, 2020|February 5, 2020|NCP|China|February 3, 2020|NCP|China|Hubei Province|NCP|NCP|China|Hubei|Hubei|Wuhan|NCP|NCP|China|February 12, 2020|China|Hubei","medrvix","","","","GPE|DATE|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-18","","10.1101/2020.02.17.20024034","biorxiv_medrxiv"

An objective estimation of the probability of cases arising in the future is important to reduce the risk of post-declaration flare-ups. We developed a simulation-based model to quantify that probability. We tested it on simulated Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) data and found this probability was most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the delay between symptom onset and recovery or death of the last detected case. For EVD, our results suggest that the current WHO criterion of 42 days since the outcome of the last detected case is too short and very sensitive to underreporting. The 90 days of enhanced surveillance period after the end-of-outbreak declaration is therefore crucial to capture potential flare-ups of cases. Hence, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This should be followed by a 90-day enhanced surveillance, after which the official end-of-outbreak can be declared. This corresponds to less than 5% probability of flare ups in most of the scenarios examined. Our quantitative framework could be adapted to define end-of-outbreak criteria for other infectious diseases.","541e7d329fa466fe7b961263666386dddec75894","True","","EVD|EVD|WHO|42 days|The 90 days|63 days|90-day|less than 5%","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|PERCENT","medrxiv","2020-02-20","","10.1101/2020.02.17.20024042","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity. Results We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country. Conclusions As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.","a6d2875c8b70a41ea815511417546a0689816964","True","","Wuhan|China|early December 2019|over 1,000|2019|COVID-19|China|China|Wuhan|China|China|Wuhan|Wuhan|China|COVID-19|13|China|Wuhan|Thailand|Indonesia|16|50%|four|Asia|China|China|China","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|LOC|GPE|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-20","","10.1101/2020.02.17.20024075","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19. Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined. Findings: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS. Interpretation: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians.

This study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. Method: We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed. Results: We included 710 consecutive COVID19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count. Conclusion: The prevalence of kidney impairment (hematuria, proteinuria and kidney dysfunction) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high. After adjustment for confounders, kidney impairment indicators were associated with higher risk of in-hospital death.

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6 or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6 and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public heath intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.","b9548530d954b407b35fb266e2b4192402c982a1","True","","2019-nCoV|Wuhan|Hubei Province|China|December 2019|Coronavirus Disease 2019|COVID-19|China|SEIR (Susceptible|Exposed|Infectious|Wuhan|China|two|Rt|first|Rt|1|February|Rt|1.9|2.6|3.1|11,044|70,258|227,989|29|February 2020|second|Rt|Rt|3.1|1.9|1|0.9|0.5|Wuhan|late February|58,077-84,520|55,869|February 2020|China|Wuhan|China|COVID-19|Rt","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|DATE|GPE|ORG|GPE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|PERSON","medrxiv","2020-02-23","","10.1101/2020.02.18.20024281","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19. Findings Before the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility. Interpretation COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.","36521caf90f471c9da1a4e84f8562440d73ead9a","True","","2019|Coronavirus|Wuhan|China|December 2019|China|five|COVID-19|the China National Health Commission|Wuhan|10th January to 23rd January|23rd January to 8th February|Wuhan|COVID-19|Wuhan|COVID-19|4.38|95%|CI|3.63|3.41|95%|CI|3.16-3.65|Wuhan city|3.39|95%|CI|3.09|Wuhan|Hubei","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-20","","10.1101/2020.02.18.20024315","biorxiv_medrxiv"

T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases. RESULTS The number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients (≥60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+T cells or CD4+T cells lower than 800/μL, 300/μL, or 400/μL, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients, with total T cells, CD8+T cells CD4+T cells counts lower than 800/μL, 300/μL, and 400/μL, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.","4609a2dd3568a7241548b7303e0d836e33d4d5ca","True","","2019|COVID-19|2|PHEIC|WHO|COVID-19|522|COVID-19|two|Wuhan|December 2019 to January 2020|40|14|COVID-19|years of age|Intensive Care Unit|CD8+T|300/μL|400/μL|IL-6|IL-10|TNF-α|IL-6|IL-10|TNF-α|PD-1|PD-1|COVID-19|Non-ICU|CD8+T|300/μL|400/μL","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|GPE|ORG|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-20","","10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Benjamin F Maier; Dirk Brockmann","Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^μ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents μ = 2.1 ± 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","fc7a6b5d1852c5ecce2d20fd0d73d5f957ed7055","True","","COVID-19|Mainland China|Mainland China|2.1|±|Chinese|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|LOC|LOC|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-20","","10.1101/2020.02.18.20024414","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7). The strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1-1.4), followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0-1.3). Conclusions: Psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information to address the high anxiety level.","ba1c4c0de19352d0b9ed7db6199803b621f0a8f2","True","","China|between 1 and 10 February, 2020|Wuhan|Shanghai|Wuhan|510|Wuhan|501|Shanghai|18|7-item|six|GAD-7|32.7%|Wuhan|20.4%|Shanghai|78.6%|Wuhan|63.9%|n=320|Shanghai|six|Wuhan|p<0.001|1.6|95%|1.3-1.8|1.6,|1.4-1.9|1.6|1.5|0.6|0.5-0.7|1.2|1.1|1.1|1.0-1.3","medrvix","","","","GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY","medrxiv","2020-02-20","","10.1101/2020.02.18.20024448","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However, due to the changing data of the epidemic, there is no scientific estimate of the cure rate and case fatality rate of the epidemic. This study proposes a method to estimate the cure rate and case fatality rate of COVID-19. The ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate. Moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. After simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. When j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. This method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic.","537009c0181c3269f40753f75ddca4d17ae8abae","True","","Wuhan|the end of 2019|COVID-19|a given day|a given day|days|8-10|9|about 93%|about 7%","medrvix","","","","GPE|DATE|ORG|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT","medrxiv","2020-02-20","","10.1101/2020.02.18.20024513","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods We collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hefei and Shenzhen between January 19 and February 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed. Results A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4±15.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15±17.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217). Conclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.","a09c1ad0f05bbcc256cd667ad7411e6690134370","True","","Objective|two|Hefei|Shenzhen|Coronavirus Disease 2019|Hefei|Shenzhen|between January 19 and February 11, 2020|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC|R0|COVID-19|Aggregated|the same period|Baidu Migration|R0|two|R0|157|Hefei|24:00 February 11, 2020|age of 44.4±15.6 years|74|47.1%|386|Shenzhen|202|52.3%|two|Hefei|Shenzhen|24.2%|74.9%|p=0.000|January 31 2020|the Level 1 Response|Shenzhen|R0|0.260|r=-0.452|Hefei|0.000|Shenzhen|R0|r=0.536|Hefei|0.498|r=0.217|1|R0|COVID-19|Hefei|Shenzhen|two","medrvix","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-20","","10.1101/2020.02.18.20024661","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods We included 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1 peoples hospital, Hubei, China until Feb 9th, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed. Findings All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99). Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time RT-PCR results. Interpretation Most COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe cases and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.

Design: A retrospective descriptive study Setting: China Participants: Epidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled for clinical features analysis. Main outcome measure: Prevention and control measures taken by Shanghai government, epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. Weibull distribution, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analysis. Results: COVID-19 transmission rate within Shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. Epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where >50% of cases were local. The incubation period was 6.4 (95% CI 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.9). Median time for COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (IQR: 4.8-11.0 days).

Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. Methods: We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. Results: We observed 50,995 (37001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city. However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend. The predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models. Conclusions: This study shows the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City has reached the peak and was decreasing. However, there is a possibility of upward trend.","","False","","2019-nCoV|tens of thousands|China|2019-nCoV|Farr|Farr|daily|2019-nCoV|China|2|2019-nCoV|China|Hubei Province|Wuhan City|Chinese|Hubei|Farr|Feb. 8, 2020|daily|2019-nCoV|China|Hubei Province|Wuhan City|50,995|37001|China|January 16 to February 15, 2020|daily|China|Hubei Providence|Wuhan City|daily|2019-nCoV|February 25|China|Hubei Province|March 8|Wuhan|75%|daily|3|daily|2019-nCoV|China|Hubei Province|Wuhan City","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP|GPE|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|ORG|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-23","","10.1101/2020.02.19.20025148","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The cumulative number of reported deaths is at 637 as of February 7, 2020. Here we statistically estimated the time-delay adjusted death risk for Wuhan as well as for China excluding Wuhan to interpret the current severity of the epidemic in China. We found that the latest estimates of the death risk in Wuhan could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas we estimate it ~1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas. Because the elevated death risk estimates are likely associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system, enhanced public health interventions including social distancing and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to bring the epidemic under control.","","False","","first|Novel Coronavirus|2019-nCov|December 2019|Wuhan City|China|China|637|February 7, 2020|Wuhan|China|Wuhan|China|Wuhan|as high as 20%","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|WORK_OF_ART|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERCENT","medrxiv","2020-02-23","","10.1101/2020.02.19.20025163","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The most common organ damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. In the patients' last examination before death, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in 17 patients (17/25, 68%) and 18 patients (18/25, 72%), lymphocyte counts were decreased in 22 patients (22/25, 88%). Most patients' PCT, CRP and SAA levels were elevated, the percentages were 90.5% (19/21), 85% (19/20) and 100% (21/21) respectively. The levels of the last test of neutrophils (15/16, 93.8%), PCT (11/11, 100%), CRP (11/13, 84.6%), cTnI (8/9, 88.9%), D-Dimer (11/12, 91.6%) and LDH (9/9, 100%) were increased as compared to the first test, while the levels of lymphocytes were decreased (14/16, 87.5%). Interpretation The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-Dimer and LDH levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts.","3c94f582610453b6c1389c3a5d6ad57bcf0ba033","True","","2019|Wuhan|Hubei Province|China|December 2019|February 13, 2020|59883|COVID-19|China|1368|COVID-19|COVID-19|25|COVID-19|Renmin Hospital|Wuhan University|Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020|Two|71.48 years|10.56 days|16/25|64%|10/25, 40%|8/25|32%|5/25|20%|4/25|16%|COPD|2/25|8%|2/25|8%|1/25|4%|17|17/25|68%|18|18/25, 72%|22|22/25|88%|SAA|90.5%|19/21|85%|19/20|100%|21/21|15/16|93.8%|PCT|11/11, 100%|11/13|84.6%|8/9|88.9%|D-Dimer|11/12|91.6%|LDH|9/9|100%|first|14/16|87.5%|COVID-19|Malnutrition|SAA|PCT|D-Dimer|LDH","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.19.20025239","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients. Methods 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography (CT) scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time RT-PCR. Findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease. In addition, 5 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2, and diagnosed as COVID-19. Beside the treatment of COVID-19, CRRT was also applied three times weekly. The course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable, without exacerbation of CRF, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CRF were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without renal illness before, and one patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 ORF 1ab from 5 cases with CRF. Interpretation Acute renal impairment was uncommon in COVID-19.

Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP were included, of which 15 (10.6%) patients developed severe NCP during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and 95% CI, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported patients but not in imported patients. However, no significant difference in lung involvement was found on CT between imported and nonimported patients (all P > 0.05). Patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to have more severe lung involvement. Spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between CT severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all P < 0.05). Conclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.","4e2bc97a6164191ba3d53abfa49ccd973aa80326","True","","CT|2019|NCP|224|2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|CT|Clinical|NCP|at least 14 days|NCP|CT|two|NCP|141|NCP|15|10.6%|NCP|Multivariate|NLR|95%|CI|1.26|1.04|0.018|CT|OR|95%|CI|1.25|1.08|NCP|CT|0.05|more than 4 days|CT|0.05|CT|NCP|Wuhan|CT","medrvix","","","","ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE|NORP|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|GPE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-23","","10.1101/2020.02.19.20025296","biorxiv_medrxiv"

A series of intervention strategies have been implemented, but didn't stop its spread. Methods: Two mathematical models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in the city of Wuhan and in other parts of China. Special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse). Findings: The basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated for the period between 18 January 2020 and 16 February 2020: R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area). At the same time, Wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February 2020. The number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area) peaked around February 3. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in Wuhan occurred on February 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on February 3. Concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases. The model further shows that the COVID-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the entire country. The five cities with top risk index in China with the exclusion of Wuhan are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city. Interpretations: Although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. As the Return-to-Work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the COVID-19 in other cities outside of Wuhan.","","False","","first|Wuhan|China|the Coronavirus Disease 2019|Two|Wuhan|China|Isse|R0|between 18 January 2020|16 February 2020|R0|5.75|1.69|Wuhan|6.22|1.67|Wuhan|Wuhan|around 6 February 2020|Wuhan|February 3|Wuhan|February 6|February 3|COVID-19|Wuhan|13,030|February 14|the end of April 2020|Wuhan|China|March 27|Wuhan|March 19|five|China|Wuhan|Huanggang|Xiaogan|Jingzhou|Chongqing|Xiangyang city|Isse|COVID-19|Wuhan","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-23","","10.1101/2020.02.19.20025387","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This study aimed to assess the population mental health burden during the epidemic, and to explore the potential influence factors. Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regressions were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem. Results: Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people (P<0.001). Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep quality (P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and times to focus on the COVID-19 (≥ 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were associated with poor sleep quality. Conclusions: Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during COVID-19 epidemic in China. Young people, people who spent too much time on the epidemic, and healthcare workers were at high risk for mental illness.

We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital.

Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age ≥ 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age ≥ 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L; age < 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age < 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L, 0%) (P <0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.","f854d7b750541d65c48df953a65028a50ce57881","True","","2|Wuhan|China|COVID-19|COVID-19|one|January 21 to February 5, 2020|Demographic|577|at least one|55 years|39 - 66|254|44.0%|22.8%|100/438|37.7%|75/199|8.4 days|5.8|39|12-day|8.7%|95%|CI|5.9%|11.5%|ACP|C-reactive Protein|ACP|three|12-day|three|age ≥ 60 years|33.2%|95%|CI|19.8%|44.3%|two|age ≥ 60 years|34|60 years|CRP ≥ 34|5.6%|95%|CI|0 to|11.3%|60 years|34|0%|0.001|ACP|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|PRODUCT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-23","","10.1101/2020.02.20.20025510","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The changes of blood routine and biochemical indexes at discharge and admission were compared. Compare the clinical characteristics of severe patients (including severe and critical patients) and non- severe patients (general patients). Results： Of 51 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) and 32 (62.7%) were men.43（84.3%）patients had been to Wuhan or Other Hubei areas outside Wuhan，and 4（7.7%） patients had a clear contact history of COVID-19 patients before the onset of the disease, and 4（7.7%） patients had no clear epidemiological history of COVID-19.Common symptoms included fever (43 [84.3%]), cough (38 [74.5%]) and fatigue (22 [43.1%]). Lymphopenia was observed in 26 patients (51.0%), and elevated C-reactive protein level in 32 patients (62.7%). Ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (41 [80.4%])，Local consolidation of pneumonia in some patients(17 [33.3%]).Most of the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine decoction (28 [54.9%])，all of them received aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon a-1b for injection and oral antiviral therapy with Lopinavir and Ritonavir tablets (51 [100%]); Most of the patients were given Bacillus licheniformis capsules regulated intestinal flora treatment (44 [86.3%]). 10 patients (19.6%) received short-term (3-5 days) glucocorticoid treatment. Compared with non-severe patients (n = 44), severe patients (n = 7) were older (median age, 52 years vs 44 years), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (4 [57.1%] vs 0 [0.0%]), most of them needed antibiotic treatment (7 [100%] vs 4 [9.1%], most of them needed nutritional diet (6 [85.7%) vs 0 [0.0%], and were more likely to have dyspnea (6 [85.7%] vs 5 [11.4%])，most of them needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation (6 [85.7%] vs 0 [0.0%]). Except one patient died, the remaining 50 patients were discharged according to the discharge standard, the common clinical symptoms disappeared basically, the lymphocyte increased significantly (P=0.008), CRP decreased significantly (P <0.001). The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR, 9-13). Conclusion：In 51 single center cases confirmed as COVID-19 and discharged from the hospital, 13.7% of the patients were severe. The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough and asthenia，Some patients had obvious dyspnea. They had clinical laboratory and radiologic characteristics. There is no specific drug treatment for the disease. For the treatment of COVID-19, in addition to oxygen inhalation and antiviral treatment, attention should be paid to the dialectical treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, regulation of intestinal flora, nutritional support treatment and other comprehensive treatment.","","False","","December 2019|Severe|Coronavirus Disease 2019，COVID-19|Wuhan|COVID-19|Wuhan|51|Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital|Chongqing|China|January 20 to February 3|2020；The|January 29 to February 11, 2020|51|covid-19|51|COVID-19|45 years|34-51|16-68 years|32|62.7%|Wuhan|Hubei|Wuhan，and|4（7.7%|COVID-19|4（7.7%|COVID-19.Common|43|84.3%|38|74.5%|22|43.1%|Lymphopenia|26|51.0%|32|62.7%|41|80.4%])，Local|33.3%]).Most|Chinese|28|Lopinavir and Ritonavir|51|100%|44|86.3%|10|19.6%|3-5 days|44|7|52 years vs 44 years|4|57.1%|0.0%|7 [100%|4|9.1%|6|85.7%|0.0%|6|85.7%|5|6|85.7%|0.0%|one|50|0.001|12 days|9|51|COVID-19|13.7%|COVID-19|COVID-19|Chinese","medrvix","","","","DATE|NORP|ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP","medrxiv","2020-02-23","","10.1101/2020.02.20.20025536","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Administration of convalescent plasma may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections. However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose convalescent plasma use in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza. Methods. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. The primary outcome was case fatality rates by influenza. Results. We identified 5 RCTs of severe influenza. The pooled analyses showed no evidence for a reduction in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.06; p = 0.87; I2 = 35%). We also found non significant reductions in days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. There seemed to have a biological benefit of increasing HAI titer levels and decreasing influenza B virus loads and cytokines after convalescent plasma treatment. No serious adverse events was reported between two groups. Studies were commonly of low risk of bias with high quality. Conclusions. Convalescent plasma appears safe but may not reduce mortality in severe influenza. This therapy should be studied within the context of a well designed clinical trial for treatment of SARS Cov 2 infection.","8d6d3be5f9353eb3358b44e646c83f1a90861b4d","True","","Healthcare|February 2020|5|Odds Ratio (OR|1.06|0.87|35%|days|ICU|and days|HAI|two|2","medrvix","","","","ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-23","","10.1101/2020.02.20.20025593","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Aim to provide recommendations for the understanding and prevention of COVID-19. Methods: By searching pubmed, we analyzed and compared the typical cases of SARS and COVID-19 in different countries in the early stage of the outbreak. Clinical records, laboratory results, imageological diagnosis and pathologic condition were retrospectively reviewed for these cases. This paper adopts the method of descriptive statistics and tables and graphs. Findings: Six SARS-related articles (N=337 participants) and 12 COVID-19-related articles (N=50,096 participants) were eligible for this systematic review. Fever, cough and Malaise/Fatigue were the most common symptoms in SARS and COVID-19. But in general, the clinical symptoms and signs of COVID-19 were not obvious. Compared with SARS, COVID-19 was transmitted in a more diverse way, from person to person, asymptomatic infected people and possible fecal-oral transmission, created the conditions for a large-scale spread. The mortality rates of SARS and COVID-19 were (7.7%) and (2.2%) respectively, but the overall infection rate of healthcare worker of COVID-19 (3.9%) was lower than that of SARS (40.0%). We also summarize the current reports on the pathology of COVID-19, we found that the pathological features of COVID-19 have greatly similar with SARS, which manifested as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interpretation: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS and COVID-19 in China are very similar, but also difference. In general, COVID-19 is transmitted in more diverse ways and is more infectious, so the early recognition of disease by healthcare worker and patient is very important. Active and effective isolation measures for suspected and close contacts are necessary.","","False","","COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|Clinical|Six|12|Malaise/Fatigue|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|7.7%|2.2%|COVID-19|3.9%|40.0%|COVID-19|COVID-19|ARDS|COVID-19|China|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.20.20025601","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Methods: Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. Findings: None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Interpretation: The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","a36bfdd1c9a1666401269fb0c08a3c2922bd6812","True","","2019|Limited|24|COVID-19|Nanjing|Jiangsu Province|China|Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020|CT|24|Five|20.8%|Twelve|50.0%|CT|five|20.8%|seven|29.2%|CT|seven|14.0 years|0.012|24|COVID-19|the first day|the first day|9.5 days|up to 21 days|24|COVID-19|up to three weeks","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-23","","10.1101/2020.02.20.20025619","biorxiv_medrxiv"

SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.","bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4","True","","2019-nCoV|COVID-19|more than 70,000|17 years ago|CoV|COVID-19|ORF1ab|6|11|BLAST|7|2|2|Taqman|RNA|10|2019-nCoV|15-40 minutes|2019-nCoV","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|PERSON|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|TIME|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-24","","10.1101/2020.02.20.20025874","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities. Findings Proportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p<0.001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p<0.001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P<0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures.

Diagnostic test based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) was the main means of confirmation, and sample collection was mostly throat swabs, which was easy to miss the diagnosis. It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher detection efficiency and accuracy. Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay. Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001). Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.","","False","","December 2019|Wuhan|China|54|RNA|2019-nCoV|qRT|2019-nCoV|76.9%|44.2%|Sputum|qRT-PCR|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|NORP|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-23","","10.1101/2020.02.21.20026187","biorxiv_medrxiv"

It severely threats people's health of thousands in Chin and even other countries. In order to prevent its wide spread, it is necessary to understand the development of the epidemic with precise mathematical language. METHODS The various data of novel coronavirus pneumonia were collected from the official websites of the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China. According to epidemic and administrative division, three groups were divided to analyze the data, Hubei Province (including Wuhan), nationwide without Hubei and Henan Province. With classic SIR models, the fitting epidemiological curves of incidence have made, and basic reproduction number (R0) was also calculated as well.

Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. Results The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.","87b89b038b28d2ba0bcfd2203845bf15f922c1b5","True","","COVID-19|Wuhan City of Hubei Province|December 2019|China|Hubei|8,579|Hubei|China|February 17, 2020|Bayesian|Rt|44 years|4.4 days|0.0|January 27 to 2.6 days|0.0-9.0|January 28 to February 17|5.2 days|1.8-12.4|5.1 days|1.3-11.6|Hubei|less than three weeks|Rt|1.04-1.85|Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province|2.17|1.69|Shandong Province|the end of January|Hubei Province","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|NORP|PERSON|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|GPE|DATE|ORG|MONEY|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-23","","10.1101/2020.02.21.20026328","biorxiv_medrxiv"

"Huazhen Lin; Wei Liu; Hong Gao; Jinyu Nie; Qiao Fan","Trends in Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus-infected Pneumonia in Wuhan and 29 Provinces in China","Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (COVID- 19) represents a significant public health threat. The COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health in- tervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling. Method: Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from January 20, 2020 to Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R_t) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty. Findings: We estimated that R_t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes which be- came stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan. Interpretation: Public health interventions implemented at both the so- cial and personal levels are effective in preventing outbreaks of COVID-19 in Wuhan and other provinces. Model prediction results suggested that COVID- 19 will be contained around the end of February 2020 in China.

Methods: Index cases were identified and reported after symptoms onset, and contact tracing was conducted to collect the data of the associated secondary cases. An interval censored likelihood framework is adopted to fit a Gamma distribution function to govern the SI of COVID-19. Findings: Assuming a Gamma distributed model, we estimated the mean of SI at 4.4 days (95%CI: 2.9−6.7) and SD of SI at 3.0 days (95%CI: 1.8−5.8) by using the information of all 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong. Conclusion: The SI of COVID-19 may be shorter than the preliminary estimates in previous works. Given the likelihood that SI could be shorter than the incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission may occur, and extra efforts on timely contact tracing and quarantine are recommended in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.","","False","","2|Wuhan|China|December 2019|21|Hong Kong|SI|Gamma|SI|Gamma|SI|4.4 days|2.9−6.7|SD of SI|3.0 days|1.8−5.8|21|Hong Kong|SI of COVID-19|SI|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.21.20026559","biorxiv_medrxiv"

In contrast, this paper looks towards epidemiological models during this phase of viral growth, in particular, by providing a responsive, timely model of the R value based on the previous few days' results. Such an R value, although bearing less statistical precision due to limited sampling, could allow R to become a more effective, responsive standalone measure of infectious transmission.

We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%).

This new type of pneumonia is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Among the different disease types, cancer patients are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance, and the majority of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive. This prompts us to consider if cancer patients were at an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 1,524 cancer patients who were managed at our tertiary cancer institution-Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were reviewed during the period of Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020. It was found that cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 than the general population. We identified twelve patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with two recorded deaths (16.7%), albeit one patient passed away from a COVID-19 unrelated cause. Interestingly, only five of these patients were ongoing treatment at the time of contracting the virus, suggesting that hospital visitation was the likely factor contributing to the elevated incidence in cancer patients. Moreover, we also observed that the incidence of severe COVID-19 was not higher than in the general population. Consequently, for cancer patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","5a9164999237a46d3d6aed53bd59b17d91a9e6d0","True","","December 2019|2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|1,524|tertiary|Zhongnan|Wuhan University|Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020|an estimated 2-fold|COVID-19|twelve|two|16.7%|one|COVID-19|only five|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.22.20025320","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: 2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for this novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed and compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR). Results: 2019-nCoVs sequenced in our study were conserved with the Wuhan strain, and shared certain genetic similarity with SARS-CoV. A high degree of variation in the level of viral RNA was observed in clinical specimens.

Methods We collected the cumulative number of confirmed cases of all cities and regions affected by COVID-19 in the world from January 20 to February 4, 2020, and calculated the daily means of the average, minimum and maximum temperatures in January. Then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships. Results There were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in China and 26 overseas countries. In total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from Hubei Province. The lgN rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72℃ and then slowly declined. The apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70℃ and 12.42℃ respectively. The curves shared similar shapes. Under the circumstance of lower temperature, every 1℃ increase in average, minimum and maximum temperatures led to an increase of the cumulative number of cases by 0.83, 0.82 and 0.83 respectively. In the single-factor model of the higher-temperature group, every 1℃ increase in the minimum temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases by 0.86. Conclusion The study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan.

More severe patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%]), such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]) and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]). CONCLUSION: Compared with non-severe patients with COVID-19, severe patients commonly had neurologic symptoms manifested as acute cerebrovascular diseases, consciousness impairment and skeletal muscle symptoms.","7fd337f16780aba8f1e599ce7516dc9b1d80a546","True","","2019|COVID-19|Three|the Union Hospital|Huazhong University of Science and Technology|Wuhan|China|Two hundred fourteen|2|16 January 2020|19 February 2020|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES|Clinical|three|PNS|two|214|88|41.1%|126|58.9%|58.7 ±|15.0 years|48.9|±|14.7 years|42|47.7%|41|32.5%|32|36.4%|19|15.1%|40|45.5%|92|73%|30|34.1%|77|61.1%|Seventy-eight|36.4%|40|45.5%|38|30.2%|5|5.7%|1|0.8%|13|14.8%|3|2.4%|17|19.3%|6|4.8%|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|MONEY|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.22.20026500","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The illness was caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from no symptom to fatal pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named the diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real time RT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods, quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc. Variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of this assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of this assay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197/276) and 57.2% (158/276) respectively.

"Chuanliang Han; Yimeng Liu; Saini Yang","Intrinsic growth rules of patients infected, dead and cured with 2019 novel coronavirus in mainland China","Background An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) was first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread rapidly to other regions. It has been declared that at least one confirmed case infected by SARS-CoV-2 was found in each province of China by late January 2020. Methods We collected the time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland China. A simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19. Furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19 in Hubei with that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, which was obtained from the Ministry of Public Health of China in 2003. Results The feature of data of three population groups in all the provinces could be well captured (R-square>0.95) by the proposed descriptive model with slight variation among different provinces. By comparing fitted parameters, we found that the fitted curve of the infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period in both COVID-19 and SARS. While all three population groups of SARS are later to saturate and have a longer semi-saturation period than that of COVID-19. Conclusions Our model is robust and stable to depict the intrinsic growth rule for the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases in 30 provinces, which could depict the epidemic situation in mainland China very well. Despite the virus caused SARS (SARS-CoV) and the virus caused COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are homologous, their epidemiologic characteristics are quite different. The duration of the outbreak would be shorter for COVID-19.","8b2e50eb3ea84225580fbdbccccb4fcd3f062feb","True","","COVID-19|first|Wuhan|China|December 2019|at least one|China|late January 2020|31|China|COVID-19|COVID-19|Hubei|Beijing|the Ministry of Public Health of China|2003|three|R-square>0.95|COVID-19|three|COVID-19|30|China|CoV|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.23.20024802","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We report the laboratory results of conjunctival PCR-tests and some clinical features of these patients in shenyang China. Design: This is a cross-sectional non-randomized study. Subjects: The study include 14 confirmly diagnosed cases, 16 suspected cases and some medical observed patients. Methods: All patients with diagnosed and suspected COVID-19 were admitted to a designated hospital in Shenyang,China. We collected conjunctival samples of these patients to do the laboratory tests by real time RT-PCR.Medical observed patients were enrolled if they had clinical symptoms. Then we analysed the PCR results and clinical data from eletronic medical records in order to find some relationships. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical condition and PCR results of conjunctival swabs compared with other specimens. Results: One of the identified case coverted from suspected case without typical clinical symptoms. Twenty-two medical observed cases were removed because none of them converted to identified cases.One of the suspected converted to identified case recently.The included cases in our study are imported cases with less underlying diseases and the severity of their infection was relatively moderate. All the conjunctival results of PCR-test were negative. Two cases had typical clinical symptoms but were finally confirmed by repeated pharynx swab tests. Conclusion: Conjunctiva may be a transmission way of COVID-19. And ocular conjunctival swabs in combination with PCR test could be a non-invasive,convenient and feasible diagnostic method for identifying the infection of COVID-19. Emphasis on the false-negative results is vital.","","False","","2019|China|14|16|COVID-19|Shenyang|China|RT-PCR.Medical|PCR|Clinical|PCR|One|Twenty-two|One|Two|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.23.20024935","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The symptoms of COVID-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages, whereas notFABP4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in BALF from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of COVID-19. This study first reported the cellular atlas of lung bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment in COVID-19 patients at the single-cell resolution, and unveiled the potential immune mechanisms underlying disease progression and protection in COVID-19.","bbba5ff9ab9eccef99a0bbc6ea557a373158bbcd","True","","Coronavirus|WHO|more than 2|000|Wuhan City|Hubei|China|December, 2019|COVID-19|ARDS|BALF|3|3|COVID-19|8|RNA|scRNA-seq|TCR-seq|BALF|ARDS|COVID-19|first|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-26","","10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (≥65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P<0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P<0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, P= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with SARS. Conclusions and Relevance: Older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with COVID. While men and women have the same susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility.","bf39a81c9aab9e0569f33d93d5e203d320dac024","True","","Novel Coronavirus|seventeen years ago|COVID-19|43|first|37|COVID-19|Wuhan|1019|six|China|524|139|Beijing|early 2003|Main Outcomes|COVID-19|years|COVID-19|83.8|13.2|37.4|4.9|COVID-19|1019|COVID-19|70.3|50.0|95%|CI|1.47|1.05|0.025|CoV","medrvix","","","","PERSON|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|PERSON|PERSON|DATE|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.23.20026864","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images. Materials and Methods We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. Based on the collected dataset, a deep learning-based CT diagnosis system (DeepPneumonia) was developed to identify patients with COVID-19. Results The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from others with an excellent AUC of 0.99 and recall (sensitivity) of 0.93. In addition, our model was capable of discriminating the COVID-19 infected patients and bacteria pneumonia-infected patients with an AUC of 0.95, recall (sensitivity) of 0.96. Moreover, our model could localize the main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is of great help to assist doctors in diagnosis. The diagnosis for a patient could be finished in 30 seconds, and the implementation on Tianhe-2 supercompueter enables a parallel executions of thousands of tasks simultaneously. An online server is available for online diagnoses with CT images by http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/server/Ncov2019. Conclusions The established models can achieve a rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 in human samples, thereby allowing identification of patients.","6bdd6867205d9b09f833f01c65f1bbfdae469164","True","","Wuhan|China|COVID-19|CT|CT|88|two|China|101|86|CT|DeepPneumonia|COVID-19|COVID-19|AUC|0.99|0.93|COVID-19|AUC|0.95|0.96|GGO|30 seconds|Tianhe-2|thousands|CT|http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/server/Ncov2019|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|TIME|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.23.20026930","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: We performed a retrospective study on the clinical characteristics of 128 COVID-19 cases with laboratory-confirmed from Xiangyang No 1 Hospitalad during January 2020 to 16 February 2020. Results: Female patients account for 53.1%. The aged below 20 years that accounts for 1.6% of overall patients. The aged in 21~50, 51~65, over 66 years were accounts for 44.5%, 35.1%,18.8%, respectively. In the difference age spectrum, all severe groups compared with non-severe groups were difference significantly ( P < 0.01 ). Fever ( 89.8% ) and Cough ( 67.2% ) were common clinical symptoms. The rate of patients with sore throats (14.1%) was rare. The rate of chest computed tomography scan showing ground glass opacity in overall, non-severe, severe groups were 63.3%, 60.7%, 76.2%, respectively. White blood cell counts in the normal range of overall patients, but severe group patients were increased significantly ( P < 0.01). Lymphocytes of overall patients were decreased. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in the normal range of overall patients, but its were elevated in the severe group. Creatinine (CR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of overall patients in the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level of all patients were increased markedly, but it in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe group ( P < 0.01 ). Conclusions: Our data provide more information that advanced age, lower lymphocytes levels at the diagnosed COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for unfavourable prognosis. The white blood cells and C-reactive protein level elevated in severe COVID-19 patients may be accompanying bacterial infection. 2019-nCov may be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function.","e4701bdf5d414ea8ca38a4d8d3f69540805293b0","True","","December 2019|China|COVID-19|128|Xiangyang No 1 Hospitalad|January 2020|16 February 2020|53.1%|20 years|1.6%|21~50|66 years|44.5%|35.1%,18.8%|0.01|89.8%|Cough|67.2%|14.1%|63.3%|60.7%|76.2%|0.01|ALT|AST|Creatinine (CR|BUN|0.01|COVID-19|COVID-19|2019-nCov","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.23.20026963","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Medley","Inferring transmission trees to guide targeting of interventions against visceral leishmaniasis and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis","Understanding of spatiotemporal transmission of infectious diseases has improved significantly in recent years. Advances in Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which novel estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyse longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on infectiousness of VL and PKDL, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: >85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were <300m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were <4 months for 90% of VL infectors, but up to 2.75yrs for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary VL cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0-6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced VL incidence by up to a quarter. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally-targeted interventions against VL.","1d882d90109fb4496088342cf2bcaa4fec40cf9f","True","","recent years|Bayesian|PKDL|Bangladesh|VL|PKDL|VL|PKDL|VL|55%|>85%|300m|<4 months|90%|PKDL|VL cases per VL|PKDL|0|PKDL|up to a quarter|PKDL|Indian|VL","medrvix","","","","DATE|NORP|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|QUANTITY|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|NORP|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.24.20023325","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information.

Background: Differential diagnosis and management for perforated appendicitis and non-perforated appendicitis and the infectious etiology of appendicitis are current hot topics. Methods: Field investigation for Tibetan students were carried out and reports published in English and Chinese medical journals were reviewed. Results: The literature review included 473 patients in 7 cluster/outbreaks of appendicitis in 6 provinces and autonomous regions. All the clusters/outbreaks occurred in group living units. We found two classic entities of appendicitis with natural history from non perforated appendicitis to perforated appendicitis and two entities of non-perforated appendicitis . In classic entities, one may represent majority of sporadic patients and the other may represent partial sporadic patients with obvious gastrointestinal manifestation. In entities of non-perforated appendicitis, one was identical to features of sporadic non-perforated appendicitis and the other one is identical to the following Tibetan students and associated with Fusobacterium. The field investigation for 120 Tibetan students with appendicitis showed that the resected appendices exhibited diffuse or focal hemorrhages and infiltration by eosinophils and by lymphocytes. Most patients had normal body temperature, white blood cell count and neutrophil count. This is a new entity of appendicitis. The clusters/outbreaks of appendicitis showed the features of infectious disease in epidemiology. The entity of perforated appendicitis was not found. Conclusion: Studying cluster/outbreak is a good method to differentiate different entities of appendicitis and infectious etiology.","47f65bff75b7752a38ccbb540fbd74955b3addea","True","","Tibetan|English|Chinese|473|7|6|two|two|one|Tibetan|Fusobacterium|120|Tibetan|neutrophil","medrvix","","","","NORP|LANGUAGE|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|LOC|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-26","","10.1101/2020.02.24.20026021","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) patients (including 2 deaths) of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019. Results：Of the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 (4.88%), 32 (78.05%), 4 (9.75%) and 3 (7.32%) patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 (24.4%) patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more than normal value. 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. CT scan showed low EAT density in severe and critical patients. Conclusion: Our results indicated that cardiac injury of COVID-2019 was rare in light and mild patients, while common in severe and critical patients. Therefore, the monitoring of the heart functions of COVID-2019 patients and applying potential interventions for those with abnormal cardiac injury related characteristics, is vital to prevent the fatality.","5b1a2b3207e3f674b94f6f271b92c29f3a8a6754","True","","41|2019|2|Beijing Youan Hospital|China|Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020|CT|41|2|4.88%|32|78.05%|4|9.75%|3|7.32%|6th|the National Health Commission of China|10|24.4%|CAD|2|40-fold|2|160","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-27","","10.1101/2020.02.24.20027052","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.","d9eeeb81d17be6a722b11081f13576de197d249f","True","","COVID-19|Wuhan|Renmin Hospital|Wuhan University|January 14, 2020|the day|first|February 17, 2020|the day|37|230|4|33|COVID-19|COVID-19|two|one|January 21|February 4|COVID-19|February 13|7|6|COVID-19|1|COVID-19|COVID-19|CT|ICU|PBMCs|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|FAC|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Francisco Caramelo; Nuno Ferreira; Barbara Oliveiros","Estimation of risk factors for COVID-19 mortality - preliminary results","Since late December 2019 a new epidemic outbreak has emerged from Whuhan, China. Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest (OR=12.8328 CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic respiratory disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]). Males are more likely to die from COVID-19 (OR=1.8518 (CI95%[1.5996; 2.1270]). Some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results. A final point of paramount importance is that the equation presented here can be used to determine the probability of dying from COVID-19 for a particular patient, given its age interval, gender and comorbidities associated.","6f53b9dff58818839c45410d11b58f0f3e327d8a","True","","late December 2019|Whuhan|China|China|CDC|the 11th February 2020|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|60|18.8161|41.5517|15.8643|10.4319|COVID-19|CI95%[1.5996|2.1270|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.24.20027268","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks.

Fisman; Kamran Khan","Estimation of COVID-2019 burden and potential for international dissemination of infection from Iran","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and continues to spread globally, with exported cases confirmed in 28 countries at the time of writing. During the interval between February 19 and 23, 2020, Iran reported its first 43 cases with eight deaths. Three exported cases originating in Iran were identified, suggesting a underlying burden of disease in that country than is indicated by reported cases. A large epidemic in Iran could further fuel global dissemination of COVID-19. We sought to estimate COVID-19 outbreak size in Iran based on known exported case counts and air travel links between Iran and other countries, and to anticipate where infections originating in Iran may spread to next. We assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries using using International Air Transport Association (IATA) data. We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic that would result in cases being observed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada. Time at risk estimates were based on a presumed 6 week epidemic age, and length of stay data for visitors to Iran derived from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran, and destination country rankings on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak . Scores range between 0-1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. UAE, Lebanon, and Canada ranked 3rd, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from Iran in February 2019. We estimated that 18,300 (95% confidence interval: 3770 to 53,470) COVID-19 cases would have had to occur in Iran, assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the country, in order to observe these three internationally exported cases reported at the time of writing. Results were robust under varying assumptions about undiagnosed case numbers in Syria, Azerbaijan and Iraq. Even if it were assumed that all cases were identified in all countries with certainty, the "best case" outbreak size was substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases), and far higher than reported case counts. Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics.","ffbd7555a337706238c211197b221795e4e35146","True","","Wuhan|China|late 2019|28|between February 19 and 23, 2020|Iran|first|43|eight|Three|Iran|Iran|COVID-19|COVID-19|Iran|Iran|Iran|Iran|International Air Transport Association|IATA|Fraser|the United Arab Emirates|UAE|Lebanon|Canada|6 week epidemic age|Iran|the United Nations World Tourism Organization|UNWTO|Iran|the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index|between 0-1|UAE|Lebanon|Canada|3rd|21st|31st|Iran|February 2019|18,300|95%|3770|53,470|Iran|1.5 months|three|Syria|Azerbaijan|Iraq|1820|95%|CI|380-5320|COVID-19|Iran|Canada|Iran|COVID-19|Iran","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|MONEY|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.24.20027375","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Henry Han","Estimate the incubation period of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)","Motivation: Wuhan pneumonia is an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable. incubation of COVID-19 along with previous statistical analysis. Our results further indicated that the incubation difference between males and females did not demonstrate a statistical significance.","c1ae608c7ffb926a0f50a6a34c0780983274ea74","True","","Wuhan|2019|the Infectious Disease Prevention Act|China|COVID-19|as few as 2 days|14|Wuhan|COVID-19|Wuhan|COVID-19|10|China|Hubei|Wuhan|Monte Caro|COVID-19|COVID-19|Weibull|Gamma|5.84|5.0 days|Monte Carlo|age>=40 years|age<40 years|two|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","GPE|DATE|LAW|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-29","","10.1101/2020.02.24.20027474","biorxiv_medrxiv"

While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China. METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; City r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; City r=0.6358, p<0.001). The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p<0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p<0.01). Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals.","7b5be48b7769ccad2f44a8c54efcea5281a6c633","True","","COVID-19|first|Wuhan|December 2019|Chinese New Year|Wuhan|China|METHODS Spearman's|Jan 20th|Feb 19th, 2020|74,675|COVID-19|China|Feb 19th, 2020|2.84%|Hubei|3.27% vs 0.73%|Hubei|Provincial|City r=0.6311|p<0.001|Provincial|City r=0.6358|p<0.001|p<0.001|COVID-19|China|Hubei","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORDINAL|GPE|DATE|EVENT|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|NORP|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-27","","10.1101/2020.02.24.20027623","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Our research aimed to construct a system based on deep learning for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on high resolution CT, relieve working pressure of radiologists and contribute to the control of the epidemic. Methods: For model development and validation, 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including 51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients of other diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China) were retrospectively collected and processed. Twenty-seven consecutive patients undergoing CT scans in Feb, 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were prospectively collected to evaluate and compare the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia with that of the model. Findings: The model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy of 95.24%, PPV of 84.62%, and NPV of 100%; a per-image sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of 99.61% in retrospective dataset.

The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP. Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone. Conclusions. Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the diagnosis of NCIP. Application of laboratory tests may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients when they present with unexplained febrile respiratory illnesses.","bca15ad98e1d08c6a62c9c0486de84bc15a9f661","True","","2019|Novel Coronavirus|2019-nCov|CAP|CAP|84|316|CAP|ROC|ROC|AUC|CAP|Nine|RDW|AUC|0.88|Hemoglobin|HGB|AUC|0.82|RBC|ALB|EO|HCT|ALP|two|RDW|NCIP","medrvix","","","","DATE|PERSON|DATE|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-25","","10.1101/2020.02.25.20024711","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Crude mortality rate reached 49% in critical patients. Inflammation matters on disease progression. This study analyzed blood inflammation indicators among mild, severe and critical patients, helping to identify severe or critical patients early. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 100 patients were included and divided to mild, severe or critical groups. Correlation of peripheral blood inflammation-related indicators with disease criticality was analyzed. Cut-off values for critically ill patients were speculated through the ROC curve. Results：Significantly, disease severity were associated with age (R=-0.564, P<0.001), interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) (R=-0.534, P<0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (R=-0.535, P<0.001), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (R=-0.308, P<0.001), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (R=-0.422, P<0.001), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (R=-0.322, P<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (R=-0.604, P<0.001), ferroprotein (R=-0.508, P<0.001), procalcitonin (R=-0.650, P<0.001), white cell counts (WBC) (R=-0.54, P<0.001), lymphocyte counts (LC) (R=-0.56, P<0.001), neutrophil count (NC) (R=-0.585, P<0.001) and eosinophil counts (EC) (R=-0.299, P=0.01).

The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xian. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of resumption of work, show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10th and February 4th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.","160ecaaa5a766c289fc2f6b5499f0dfe7aab971c","True","","Wuhan/Hubei/China|January 23rd 2020|COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei|the Spring Festival|Shaanxi|Shaanxi|half|1.48-1.69|Xian|zero|Shaanxi|second|between January 10th and February 4th 2020|30%|60%|90%|second|Poisson","medrvix","","","","ORG|DATE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|EVENT|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|MONEY|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-29","","10.1101/2020.02.25.20027615","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Design: Retrospective case studies Setting: 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across China Participants: 1,590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients. Data were collected from November 21st, 2019 to January 31st, 2020. Main outcomes and measures: Epidemiological and clinical variables (in particular, comorbidities) were extracted from medical charts. The disease severity was categorized based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoints, which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with COVID-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities. Results: Of the 1,590 cases, the mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside Hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patients had a contact history of Wuhan city. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. 269 (16.9%), 59 (3.7%), 30 (1.9%), 130 (8.2%), 28 (1.8%), 24 (1.5%), 21 (1.3%), 18 (1.1%) and 3 (0.2%) patients reported having hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatitis B infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and immunodeficiency, respectively. 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. Patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to the composite endpoint compared with those who had a single comorbidity, and even more so as compared with those without (all P<0.05). After adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with COPD (HR 2.681, 95%CI 1.424-5.048), diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03-2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60-7.64) were more likely to reach to the composite endpoints than those without. As compared with patients without comorbidity, the HR (95%CI) was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities.

Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR. Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%，68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs. Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge.

We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing. Methods In this single-center, retrospective study, 342 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Fever Clinic in Peking University Third Hospital between January 21 to February 15, 2020. From these patients, 88 were reviewed by panel discussion as possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. COVID-19 was confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV in 19 cases, and by epidemiological, clinical and CT features in 2 cases (the COVID-19 Group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-COVID-19 group. Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT findings were collected, and compared between the two groups. Findings The prevalence of COVID-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was 6.14% (21/342). Compared with the non-COVID-19 group, more patients with COVID-19 had an identified epidemiological history (90.5% versus 32.8%, P<0.001). The COVID-19 group had lower WBC [5.19×10^9/L (±1.47) versus 7.21×10^9/L (±2.94), P<0.001] and neutrophil counts [3.39×10^9/L (±1.48) versus 5.38×10^9/L (±2.85), P<0.001] in peripheral blood.

Type I can be further divided into Type IA and IB. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the Type IA resembles the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 most. Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I.

Conclusion: Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during pandemic outbreaks is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control. It is of great significance to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of hospital infection control through the monitoring of environmental hygiene.","eca1cf50bd67a7efbcaf78864f5f5b3b850243d6","True","","2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|the First Hospital of Jilin University|seven o'clock in the morning|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|TIME|PERSON","medrxiv","2020-02-27","","10.1101/2020.02.25.20028043","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to January 31, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group. There was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. Importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 may cause the liver function damage and the Lopinavir/ritonavir should be applied carefully for the treatment of COVID-19.","baabfb35a321ea12028160e0d2c1552a2fda2dd5","True","","China|COVID-19|Abnormal|COVID-19|Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center|January 20 to January 31, 2020|February 19, 2020|148|148|49.3%|50.7%|50.5 years|36-64|70.1%|45.3%|26.7%|75|50.7%|75|44%|27.4%|0.035|62.67% vs 38.36%|0.005|Lopinavir/|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","GPE|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-27","","10.1101/2020.02.26.20026971","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Toshihisa Tomie","Relations of parameters for describing the epidemic of COVID―19 by the Kermack―McKendrick model","In order to quantitatively characterize the epidemic of COVID―19, useful relations among parameters describing an epidemic in general are derived based on the Kermack-McKendrick model. The first relation is 1/τgrow=1/τtrans−1/τinf, where τgrow is the time constant of the exponential growth of an epidemic, τtrans is the time for a pathogen to be transmitted from one patient to uninfected person, and the infectious time τinf is the time during which the pathogen keeps its power of transmission. The second relation p(∞) ≈1−exp(−(R0−1)/0.60) is the relation between p(∞), the final size of the disaster defined by the ratio of the total infected people to the population of the society,and the basic reproduction number, R0, which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of the pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time. The third relation 1/τend=1/τinf−(1−p(∞))/τtrans gives the decay time constant τend at the ending stage of the epidemic. Derived relations are applied to influenza in Japan in 2019 for characterizing the epidemic.","7344c6de7ce2258e74ce131bed72e6ad465f0ce8","True","","first|one|second|R0|one|third|Japan|2019","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|GPE|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.02.26.20027797","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a COVID-19 diagnosis, from December 30, 2019 to February 7, 2020, at Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (Rt), chest Computed Tomography (CT) were took intermittently, and SARS-COV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. Results: A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-COV-2 RNA fragments was found in ocular discharges by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR only in one patient with conjunctivitis. Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, to lower the SARS-COV-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers.","c10661c9b35e068691b879661bcebeba3bd6aad9","True","","COVID-19|December 30, 2019 to February 7, 2020|Tongji hospital|Tongji|Huazhong University of Science and Technology|Computed Tomography|CT|RT-PCR|102|48|50%|54|50%|Rt|Computed Tomography|CT|COVID-19|57.63|14.90] years|102|72|36|50%|36|50%|58.68|14.81] years|RT-PCR|Only two|2.78%|72|RNA","medrvix","","","","ORG|DATE|FAC|GPE|ORG|PERSON|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|PERSON|PERSON|NORP|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-26","","10.1101/2020.02.26.20027938","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This study aims to calculate its case fatality rate (CFR). Methods: The method, termed as converged CFR calculation, was based on the formula of dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated. Results: CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8% to 0.9%. So far, the CFR had accurately predicted the death numbers more than 3 weeks. CFR in Hubei of China was 5.4% by which the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number for 2 weeks. Conclusion: The method could be used for CFR calculating while pandemics are still ongoing. Dynamic monitoring of the daily CFRs trends could help outbreak-controller to have a clear vision in the timeliness of the case confirmation.","46634d03aa169aab9c372746ebaf3aaa65d7c7d9","True","","2019|COVID-19|more than 80 thousand|days|daily|CFR|COVID-19|China|Hubei Province|0.8%|0.9%|CFR|more than 3 weeks|Hubei|China|5.4%|2 weeks|CFR|daily","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-26","","10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. Findings The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(≥8805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P<0.04). All inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their CT results at initial diagnosis. The body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients. Interpretation Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. The system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. This type of O2O, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff.","c954675ee859e2f7b8f352a398a67469b50f05de","True","","December 2019|O2O|48|COVID-19|Wuhan|between January 6 and January 31, 2020|Fever|Muscle|Dyspnea|Lack|48|39.08(13.88) years|35(72.9%|2.4%|33.3%|P<0.04|50%|33.3%|CT|day 4-5|day 6|day 4|first|O2O","medrvix","","","","DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|DATE|GPE|PERSON|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|DATE|DATE|ORDINAL|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-29","","10.1101/2020.02.26.20028084","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Joe Hilton; Matt J Keeling","Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices","The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries. In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.","2536b83acf84368d7c13be81fe07aa0575115da7","True","","first|China|China|Eastern Europe|Japan|Africa|Central America|South-Western Asia","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|LOC|GPE|LOC|LOC|LOC","medrxiv","2020-02-27","","10.1101/2020.02.26.20028167","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital′s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of >5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), increased C-reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%). A high level of IL-6 (>10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.","a625e5d6fc8956c231c500a40e887e248a69de61","True","","Wuhan|China|82|Methods Clinical|82|Wuhan|Wuhan|65.9%|More than half|older than 60 years|80.5%|72.5 years|76.8%|56.1%|20.7%|18.3%|12.2%|7.3%|69.5%|MOF|28.0%|14.6%|6.1%|3.7%|100%|89%|80.5%|78.0%|31.7%|89.2%|74.3%|24.3%|>5|94.5%|500|89.2%|100%|93.2%|D-dimer|97.1%|IL-6|10|15 days|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-27","","10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered effective (>90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07). Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.","7aa49aa2b76ea92b9265ad9d5a9d9ef0ea585b24","True","","COVID-19|Hong Kong|Method|36 hours|first|452|COVID-19|1715|89%|97%|COVID-19|97%|daily|98%|the Hospital Anxiety|9.01|99.5%|84%|57%|54%|5%|34%|40%|Only 16%|China|77%|90%|39%-88%|the New Territories|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|PERSON|TIME|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-02-27","","10.1101/2020.02.26.20028217","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42.9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.","111b9a6e91c938696fcdb4cb128b8ae739dbe11c","True","","March 2, 2020|more than 80174|2915|China|56|January 28 to February 18, 2020|35|COVID-19|Tongji Hospital|CT|RT-PCR|35|COVID-19|37-88 years|Over 50%|35|COVID-19|one|42.9%|two|one|COVID-19|RT-PCR","medrvix","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|QUANTITY|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-27","","10.1101/2020.02.26.20028225","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19.

We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.","4bd697fdded7ee65154e28def586a7e9b60e7078","True","","COVID-19|COVID-19|China|Hubei Province|14-day|6.7%|22-day|3.3 days|7.2 days|3.7 days|6.6 days|3.9 days|1.54","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-01","","10.1101/2020.02.26.20028431","biorxiv_medrxiv"

"Yuwen Cai; Tianlun Huang; Xin Liu; Gaosi Xu","The Effects of "Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan" Makeshift Hospitals and Temperature on the Mortality of COVID-19","Background In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, however, the factors affecting the mortality remain unclear. Methods Thirty-two days of data that were shared by China National Health Commission and China Weather Net were collected using standard forms. The difference in the mortality of confirmed and severe cases before and after the use of Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan makeshift hospitals (MSHs) was tested using Mann-Whitney U test. We also studied whether air temperature (AT) could affect the above outcomes of COVID-19 cases by performing Spearman analysis. Results The mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (U = 1, P < 0.001) and Hubei (U = 0, P < 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, the mortality of confirmed cases remained unchanged (U = 40, P = 0.139). However, another eight days later, changes in the mortality in non-Hubei regions also became significant (U = 73, P = 0.039). Mortality of confirmed cases was found to be significantly correlated with temperature both in Wuhan (r = -0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r = -0.440, P = 0.012). Conclusions Our findings indicated that both the use of MSHs and the rise of AT were beneficial to the survival of COVID-19 cases.","","False","","December 2019|Wuhan|China|Thirty-two days|China National Health Commission|China|Fangcang|Huoshenshan|Leishenshan|Mann-Whitney U|AT|COVID-19|Spearman|Wuhan|0.001|Hubei|0.001|40|0.139|another eight days later|73|Wuhan|0.012|Hubei|0.012|AT|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-29","","10.1101/2020.02.26.20028472","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Tian Hao","Infection Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) Modeled with the Integration of the Eyring Rate Process Theory and Free Volume Concept","The Eyrings rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individ- uals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume frac- tion of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak time, peak infected, and R0.

However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated. Objective: To explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later. Design, Setting, and Participants A single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020. Exposures: High levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH; α-HBDH). Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days). Results: Of 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission (≥ 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was associated with higher mortality. High CK-MB was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and α-HBDH levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and α-HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and α-HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). LDH level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022). Conclusions and Relevance: Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury.","","False","","2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|188|December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020|Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital|China|February 11, 2020|CK|CK-MB|LDH|Main Outcomes|188|COVID-19|51.9 years|14.26|21~83 years|119|63.3%|≥|6.126|IL-6|PCT|CK|LDH|LDH|LDH|-0.42|95%|LDH|95%|P=0.022|COVID-19|days|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|LOC|GPE|DATE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-29","","10.1101/2020.02.26.20028589","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to 22, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and compared differences between men and women. Results: Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62 years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7 [14.9%]). Procalcitonin level was higher in men than in women (0.08 vs. 0.04ng/ml, p=0.002). N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide increased in 16 (57.1%) men and 5 (26.3%) women (p=0.037). Five men (17.9%) had detected positive influenza A antibody, but no women. During 2-week admission, 5 (17.9%) men and 1 (5.3%) woman were reclassified into the critical type due to deterioration. Mortality was 3.6% in men and 0 in women respectively. Four (21.1%) women and one man (3.6%) recovered and discharged from hospital. Conclusion: Sex differences may exist in COVID-19 patients of severe type.

Effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP are needed to validate these therapeutic effects.","2d0285c90976dfa43d58eca6b7d1d7ef29994fc2","True","","ARDS|FDA|EC50|twelve|Two weeks|DIP|3|6|60%|4|100%|One|DIP|DIP|Larger|DIP","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|PERSON|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-29","","10.1101/2020.02.27.20027557","biorxiv_medrxiv"

No specific medicine against COVID-19 has been found until now. However, mortality risk in patients could potentially be predicted before they transmit to critically ill. Methods: We screened the electronic records of 2,799 patients admitted in Tongji Hospital from January 10th to February 18th, 2020. There were 375 discharged patients including 201 survivors. We built a prognostic prediction model based on XGBoost machine learning algorithm and then tested 29 patients (included 3 patients from other hospital) who were cleared after February 19th. Results: The mean age of the 375 patients was 58.83 years old with 58.7% of males. Fever was the most common initial symptom (49.9%), followed by cough (13.9%), fatigue (3.7%), and dyspnea (2.1%). Our model identified three key clinical features, i.e., lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), from a pool of more than 300 features. The clinical route is simple to check and can precisely and quickly assess the risk of death. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance. Conclusion: The three indices-based prognostic prediction model we built is able to predict the mortality risk, and present a clinical route to the recognition of critical cases from severe cases. It can help doctors with early identification and intervention, thus potentially reducing mortality.","","False","","COVID-19|Wuhan|China|December 2019|COVID-19|2,799|Tongji Hospital|January 10th to February 18th, 2020|375|201|XGBoost|29|3|February 19th|375|58.83 years old|58.7%|49.9%|13.9%|3.7%|2.1%|three|LDH|more than 300|three","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-01","","10.1101/2020.02.27.20028027",""

SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemia METHODS: The patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia. RESULTS: By Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P>0.05). Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K+ loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia. severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K+ supplements when they were inclined to recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Hypokalemia is prevailing in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal K+ loss resulting from the degradation of ACE2. The end of urine K+ loss indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker directly reflecting the end of adverse effect on RAS system.","264a816e7099246c13a5dad3a581a474d85d50bd","True","","COVID-19|RAS|METHODS|COVID-19|Feb 15, 2020|175|COVID-19|92|83|46|34-54] years|Wenzhou|China|39|67|108|CK|CK-MB|LDH|P<0.01|93%|CK|CK-MB|LDH|K+|3|34|SD=4|K+|Hypokalemia|COVID-19|K+|K+|RAS","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|GPE|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-02-29","","10.1101/2020.02.27.20028530","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Shilei Zhao; Hua Chen","Modeling the Epidemic Dynamics and Control of COVID-19 Outbreak in China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading over China and more than 30 countries in last two months. COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including a high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed case numbers, and the effects from multiple quarantine and control measures. We develop a model SUQC to adequately characterizes the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly model the control by artificial measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infected to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We find that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing have a reproductive number R>1, and after January 30, all regions have a reproductive number R<1, indicating the effectiveness of the quarantine and control measures in inhibiting COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan is 0.0643, significantly lower than 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) and 0.2189 of China (excluding Hubei), but increases to 0.3229 after Feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was adopted. The un-quarantined infected individuals in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is as high as 3,509 and decreases to 334 on February 21th, 2020. After fitting the model with recent data, we predict that the end times of COVID-19 of Wuhan and Hubei are around late-March, of China (excluding Hubei) around mid-March, and of the four tier-one cities before March 2020. A total of 80,511 individuals of the whole country are infected, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei(excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). We suggest the rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late-March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other counties in a high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan and Iran.","75e68869f9b65bca661e768402395d9dede6de2c","True","","2019|COVID-19|China|more than 30|last two months|COVID-19|COVID-19|SUQC|COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei|Wuhan|China|Hubei|four|first|China|January 30, 2020|Beijing|R>1|January 30|R<1|COVID-19|Wuhan|0.0643|0.1914 of Hubei|Wuhan|0.2189|China|Hubei|0.3229|Feb 12th|Wuhan|February 12, 2020|as high as 3,509|334|February 21th, 2020|COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei|around late-March|China|Hubei|mid-March|four|one|March 2020|80,511|49,510|Wuhan|17,679|Hubei(excluding Wuhan|13,322|China|Hubei|March|Beijing|Shanghai|Guangzhou|Shenzhen|late-March|Hubei|South Korea|Japan|Iran","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-29","","10.1101/2020.02.27.20028639","biorxiv_medrxiv"

"Feng Zhang; Jinmei Zhang; Menglan Cao; Cang Hui","A simple ecological model captures the transmission pattern of the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in China","The rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), initially reported in the city of Wuhan in China, and quickly transmitted to the entire nation and beyond, has become an international public health emergency. Estimating the final number of infection cases and the turning point (time with the fastest spreading rate) is crucial to assessing and improving the national and international control measures currently being applied. In this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when 95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February, with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March. This suggests that the current control measures in China are excellent, and more than sufficient to contain the spread of this highly infectious novel coronavirus, and that the application of such measures could be considered internationally for the global control of this outbreak.","","False","","2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|3 February 2020|China|10 February|China|78,000|95%|88,880|4th|5th|February|95%|the 24th of February|95%|the 19th of March|China","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-02-29","","10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19. Methods For this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation. Results We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26 (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28 [77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia occurred in 24 patients (70.59%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. One (2.78%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days. Interpretation Lots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.","68ed7bb581b0cf32116ee46767c08e3180b05c34","True","","Coronavirus|2019|COVID-19|China|36|COVID-19|the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan|RT-PCR|between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020|Feb 14, 2020|the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan|36|COVID-19|69.22 years|50-90|25(69.44%|11|30.56%|26|72.22%|34|94.44%|28|77.78%|21|58.33%|17|47.22%|Chest|31 (96.88%|Lymphopenia|24|70.59%|30.18|SD|4.76|25|80.65%|D-dimer|8.64|2.39|27|100%|502.5 U/L|410|26|100%|106.3|60.83|PCT|0.61|0.16|IL-6|100.6|51.51|more than half|25|69.44%|ARDS|ARDS|11 days|One|2.78%|17 days|Interpretation Lots|COVID-19|about 2 weeks|ARDS|ARDS|11 days","medrvix","","","","ORG|DATE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|FAC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERSON|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|DATE","medrxiv","2020-02-29","","10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The features of COVID-19patients withand without pneumonia,SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown. Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, andlaboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020. Results:We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42(95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to clearance was 9.71(95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared with patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low account (<190/μL) of CD8+ T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that circulating interleukin-6 andlactate independently predicted COVID-19 progression, with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.052 (1.000-1.107) and 1.082 (1.013-1.155), respectively. During disease course,T lymphocytes were generally lower,neutrophils higher, in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients. CD8+ lymphocytes did not increase at the 20th days after illness onset. Conclusion: The epidemiological features areimportant for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Circulating interleukin-6 and lactateare independent prognostic factors.

Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing Youan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed. Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed CRP ≥20 mg/L and lymphocyte count< 1.1*10^9/L were independently related to hepatic injury. Conclusions: Lymphopenia and CRP may serve as the risk factors related to hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19, which might be related to inflammatory cytokine storm in liver injury.

Shenzhen ranked the top cities outside Wuhan with reported 416 confirmed cases by February 20, 2020. Here, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shenzhen and potential link to the preventive strategies for the whole city and inside hospitals. Based on the daily new cases, the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen can be classified into three phases: the slow increase phase from January 19 to January 28, the rapid increase and plateau phase from January 29 to February 5 and the decline phase since February 6. In the three phases, the number of patients from Hubei decreased, and the number of familial clustering cases increased. The newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases reached its peak around January 31, which was 7 days after the peak date of cases arrival at Shenzhen. A series of early preventive strategies were implemented since January 19, which included detection of body temperature at all entrances of main traffic and buildings, outpatients service specially for patients with fever in all main hospitals in Shenzhen. All the patients with fever were screened with nasal or throat swab PCR detection of coronavirus 2019, Chest CT and blood lymphocyte counting in order to find out early case of COVID-19. Observation wards were established in every main hospital and a designated hospital was responsible for admission and medical care of all confirmed cases. Protection procedure was established for all medical staff involved in the screening and care of suspected and confirmed cases. 14 days isolated observation of all subjects arrived at Shenzhen from Hubei was implemented in February 2. After the implementation of all these strategies and measures, the COVID-19 cases started to decline since February 6. There were almost no community transmission and nosocomial infection occurred in Shenzhen. In conclusion, in situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in nearby province of Hubei, Shenzhen, a high population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility city, has to face the imported cases and risk of spreading the outbreak into Shenzhen city. The implementation of early preventive strategies and measures in Shenzhen were successful in early identification of COVID-19 cases and prevented major outbreak occurred in Shenzhen. Early identification of imported cases, prevention of family clustering transmission, preventive measures in the public area and very strict infection control procedure in hospital setting are crucial for the successful control of outbreak in Shenzhen.","d75c48f51b2a5c26a41fe615339e5947d5e9cb30","True","","Coronavirus|2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei|China|Shenzhen|Wuhan|416|February 20, 2020|COVID-19|Shenzhen|daily|COVID-19|Shenzhen|three|January 19 to January 28|January 29 to February 5|February 6|three|Hubei|around January 31|7 days|Shenzhen|January 19|Shenzhen|2019|Chest|COVID-19|14 days|Shenzhen|Hubei|February 2|COVID-19|February 6|Shenzhen|COVID-19|Hubei|Shenzhen|Shenzhen|Shenzhen|COVID-19|Shenzhen|Shenzhen","medrvix","","","","ORG|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|DATE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.02.28.20028555","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: Clinical data of 36 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in isolation area of Kunming Third People's Hospital from January 31 to February 15, 2020 were collected, and the basic situation, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. Serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB), hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp), CD3T cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cells and normal control group were analyzed. A simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between proalbumin and T cell subpopulation counts in the blood of patients. Results: (1) The patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming were mainly of common type. (2) 50% of the patients' first symptoms were fever and cough; (3) The total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased in 23 cases (79%), and the lymphocyte count decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), without anemia. Hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%) cases, and procalcitonin increased in 1 case. Albumin decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), proalbumin decreased in 15 cases (41.67%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), total bilirubin increased slightly in 11 cases (30.56%), and renal function and blood coagulation were normal. Absolute value of CD3+T cells is with a decrease in 21 cases (58.3%), CD4+T in 28 cases (77.8%), CD8+T in 17 cases (47.2%), and CD4+/ CD8+ inverse in 6 cases (16.7%). (4) The prealbumin, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in the new coronavirus pneumonia group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group, and the hypersensitive c-reactive protein was higher than that in the normal control group. (5) The levels of PAB in the serum of the patients were linearly correlated with hs-crp, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, and the correlation coefficients were -0.474, 0.558, 0.467 and 0.613, respectively, showing statistical differences. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The nutritional status of patients with common and mild pneumonia should be considered.","a5039336577ac0fed15b784adb912df2a6a143f3","True","","Kunming City|Clinical|36|Kunming|Third|People's Hospital|January 31 to February 15, 2020|CT|ALB|PAB|CD8T|1|Kunming|2) 50%|first|3|23|79%|5|13.89%|19|52.78%|1|Albumin|5|13.89%|15|41.67%|4|11.11%|4|11.11%|11|30.56%|CD3+T|21|58.3%|28|77.8%|CD8+T|17|47.2%|CD4+/ CD8|6|16.7%|4|5|PAB|CD8 T|0.558|0.467|0.613|Kunming|Wuhan","medrvix","","","","GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-01","","10.1101/2020.02.28.20029173","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the same as SARS-CoV. The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes.

Materials and Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire survey was conducted in 17 pediatric nephropathy diagnosis and treatment centers in China. The questions collected basic information on the patients and their parents and data on changes in the approach to medical treatment and their needs in the context of the outbreak etc. This is a Multicenter Cross-section Study. Results: A total of 735 valid questionnaires were collected. 555 patients (75.5%) and their parents said that the outbreak had a significant influence on their medical treatment: 264 patients (47.6%) said that it would be delayed by 2 to 4 weeks and 199 patients (35.9%) by 4 to 8 weeks. 510 patients (84.16%) hoped to get in touch with specialists through online consultation, and 528 patients (84.5%) hoped that online consultation could be implemented and that medication could be delivered to them.. A total of 458 patients (62.3%) said that their greatest concern was that the CKD would be aggravated or that they would experience a relapse; only 203 patients were infected by 2019-nCoV. A total of 313 patients (42.5%) experienced anxiety and thus required the intervention of psychologists. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the medical treatment of children with CKD. Online consultation, medication delivery and psychological counselling are the greatest needs reported by patients and their families and could especially provide solutions for the management of low income children with CKD in remote rural areas in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.","530f3ba1a2c044305d73123fd8d2246f63120bc3","True","","COVID-19|Chinese|CKD|17|China|735|555|75.5%|264|47.6%|2 to 4 weeks|199|35.9%|4 to 8 weeks|510|84.16%|528|84.5%|458|62.3%|CKD|only 203|2019-nCoV.|313|42.5%|COVID-19|CKD|CKD|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|NORP|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.02.28.20029199","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"","Closed environments facilitate secondary transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Commissioned by the Minister of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan, we collected secondary transmission data with the aim of identifying high risk transmission settings. We show that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Closed environments are consistent with large-scale COVID-19 transmission events such as that of the ski chalet-associated cluster in France and the church- and hospital-associated clusters in South Korea. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease. Reduction of unnecessary close contact in closed environments may help prevent large case clusters and superspreading events.","","False","","the Ministry of Health|Labour|Welfare of Japan|COVID-19|France|South Korea|China","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.02.28.20029272","biorxiv_medrxiv"

There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. Results: Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens. We highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to routine diagnostic testing in capable hospitals to prevent misdetection of the virus.","0b460e73926eb107001c95c0dfeae2362b4251b0","True","","Coronavirus Disease 2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|COVID-19|Wuhan|68|2|Qingdao|Wuhan|January 17 to February 16, 2020|IgM|68|30|44.12%|Qingdao|Qingdao|Wuhan|50|37|31|28-38) years|Qingdao|60.00%|Wuhan|55.26%|Qingdao|24|80.00%|IgM|at least one|2.63%|Wuhan|IgM|P<0.0001|Qingdao|60.00%|53.33%|23.33%|20.00%|Qingdao|only 20.90%|COVID-19|Qingdao|China|Wuhan|China","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|PRODUCT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.02.29.20027698","biorxiv_medrxiv"

A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083). However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P > 0.05). Importantly, nFLNs are more likely to suffer from VT, which might be related to two factors, namely, gender [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1717; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.247-18.808; P = 0.002] and fertility [OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626-24.533; P = 0.039]. Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the psychological problems of the medical staff, especially nFLNs, and GP under the situation of the spread and control of COVID-19. Early strategies that aim to prevent and treat VT in medical staff and GP are extremely necessary.","14783283da3482bf2aab4e6100fe4ea5c29d8db7","True","","December 2019|more than 79,000|the Corona Virus Disease|COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei|COVID-19|VT|COVID-19|214|526|VT|VT|COVID-19|0.083|VT|69|56-85|GP|75.5|62|VT|64|52-75|75.5|63-92|0.001|VT|GP|0.001|0.05|VT|two|3.1717|95%|CI|4.247|0.002|2.072|0.626|nFLNs|GP|COVID-19|VT|GP","medrvix","","","","DATE|CARDINAL|FAC|ORG|GPE|GPE|PERSON|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.02.29.20029322","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19. Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs. Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while 87.8% of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 +- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 +- 0.43 and 1.55 +- 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001). The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group (75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events. Conclusions: Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.","","False","","2019|COVID-19|2|Clinical|COVID-19|COVID-19|41|the Central Hospital|Wuhan|Wuhan|China|January 15 to January 24, 2020|March 3, 2020|80.5%|87.8%|39.1 +- 9.2|three|82.9%|80.5%|63.4%|three|80.5%|73.2%|41.5%|95.1%|China|58.5%|41.5%|0.99 +- 0.43|1.55 +- 0.61|50.0%|11.8%|79.2%|23.5%|75.0%|23.5%|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|MONEY|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|MONEY|MONEY|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348",""

It both spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective. We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country's vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19. Countries' vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country's vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries' management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic. This method can be used as a preliminary risk assessment of the spatiotemporal spread for a new global epidemic. * Note: This study was completed on February 15, 2020.","f87eec8279bc79900914c5689bb42f49f41aace5","True","","COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei Province|China|December 2019|China|January 2020|COVID-19|two|COVID-19|China|COVID-19|COVID-19|China|63|Taiwan|South Korea|Hong Kong|Japan|first|1,000|February 15, 2020","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.02.29.20029413","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic.

However, due to the low viral load in patient throat and the limitation of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which should not be ignored. Methods: We explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 57 clinical pharyngeal swab samples and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy. Among 57 samples, all of which were reported as negative nucleic acid by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection, 43 samples were collected from suspected patients with fever in clinic, and 14 were from supposed convalescents who were about to discharge after treatment. The experiment was double-blind. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimized ddPCR is at least 500 times lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of ddPCR for clinical detection is 94.3 %. 33 out of 35 negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were correctly judged by ddPCR based on the follow-up investigation. In addition, 9 out of 14 (64.2 %) supposed convalescents with negative nucleic acid test twice by RT-PCR were positive by ddPCR detection. Conclusions: ddPCR shows superiority for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negatives, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR. Before the ddPCR to be approved for diagnosis, the current clinical practice that the convalescent continues to be quarantined for 2 weeks is reasonable and necessary.","","False","","RT-PCR|RT-PCR|57|RT-PCR|57|RT-PCR|43|14|at least 500|RT-PCR|94.3 %|33|35|RT-PCR|9|14|64.2 %|RT-PCR|RT-PCR|2 weeks","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.02.29.20029439","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. Findings: The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Interpretation: Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.","7852aafdfb9e59e6af78a47af796325434f8922a","True","","RNAaemia|COVID-19|RNAaemia|48|COVID-19|the General Hospital of Central Theater Command|PLA|Wuhan|China|three|the Diagnosis|the National Health Commission of China|Generalized Linear Models|RT-PCR Ct|RNAaemia|RNAaemia|R=0.902|COVID-19|RNAaemia|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.02.29.20029520","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Yuan zheming; Chen Yuan","A simple model to assess Wuhan lock-down effect and region efforts during COVID-19 epidemic in China Mainland","Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054*x1+2.3455*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P<10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China. Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model.

Design Cross-sectional Setting Multicenter Participants A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. Intervention CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level. Main outcomes Short-term hospital stay (≤10 days) and long-term hospital stay (>10 days). Results The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminating short- and long-term hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95%CI 0.67-1.0) by LR and RF, respectively, in the test dataset.

To acquire the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 in Guizhou, China, we collected data on 162 laboratory-confirmed cases related to COVID-19. We described the demographic characteristics of the cases and estimated the incubation period, serial interval and basic reproduction number. We also presented two representative case studies in Guizhou province -- Case Study 1 was an example of asymptomatic carrier; and Case Study 2 was an example of a large and complex infection chain that involved four different districts spanning three provinces and eight families. With an estimation of 8 days incubation period and 6 days serial interval, our results indicate that there may exist infectiousness during the incubation period for 2019-nCoV. This increases the difficulty of screening or identifying cases related to COVID-19.","7e9cd4bbf0fba1cc0bcded40041fd01b9dfb683f","True","","the end of 2019|2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|Guizhou|January of 2020|COVID-19|Guizhou|China|162|two|Guizhou|Case Study 1|Case Study 2|four|three|eight|8 days|6 days|2019-nCoV.","medrvix","","","","DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.01.20028944","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Identification of a simple and effective indicator to assess disease severity and outcome is urgently needed. Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed dynamic changes of lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of COVID-19 patients. Next, prognostic role of lymphopenia in COVID-19 were verified in 92 hospitalized cases. Results: Our results from death and severe cases showed that LYM% in blood test were inversely associated with the progression and severity of COVID-19. LYM% in patients with moderate COVID-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. In contrast, LYM% was lower than 20% in severe cases. However, LYM% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. Therefore, we established a reliable Time from symptom onset-LYM% model (TLM), which could be used to evaluate disease severity and predict the outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: Lymphopenia can be used to indicate clinical course, treatment effect and outcomes of COVID-19 patients.","f19e2df932f90f387fe71533f3802875d9042160","True","","Coronavirus disease-2019|Identification|15|15|40 moderate|COVID-19|COVID-19|92|COVID-19|COVID-19|higher than 20%|10-12 days|lower than 20%|higher than|5%|17-19 days|5%|Time|TLM|COVID-19|Lymphopenia|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","PERSON|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.03.01.20029074","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods：In this retrospective, descriptive, multiple-center study, total of 267 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in Chongqing from Jan 19 to Feb 16, 2020 were recruited. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological characteristics, laboratory examinations, and treatment regimens were collected on admission. Clinical outcomes were followed up until Feb 16, 2020. Results：267 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals in Chongqing provincial municipality from January 19 to February 16, 2020 were enrolled and categorized on admission. 217 (81.27%) and 50 (18.73%) patients were categorized into non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. The median age of patients was 48.0 years (IQR, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3%) of the patients were more than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8%) patients were men. Severe patients were significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [IQR, 65.8-77.0] vs 43.0 years [IQR, 32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110 [50.7%] vs 39 [78.0%]) and have coexisting disorders (15 [30.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]). 41 (15.4%) patients had a recent travel to Hubei province, and 139 (52.1%) patients had a history of contact with patients from Hubei. On admission, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever 225(84.3%), fatigue (208 [77.9%]), dry cough (189 [70.8%]), myalgia or arthralgia (136 [50.9%]). Severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea (17 [34.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]) and confusion (10 [20.0%] vs 15 [6.9%]). Rales (32 [12.0%]) and wheezes (20 [7.5%]) are not common noted for COVID-19 patients, especially for the non-severe (11 [5.1%], 10 [4.6%]). 118 (44.2%). Most severe patients demonstrated more laboratory abnormalities. 231 (86.5%), 61 (22.8%) patients had lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. CD4+T cell counts decrease was observed in 77.1 % of cases, especially in the severe patients (45, 100%). 53.1% patients had decreased CD+3 T cell counts, count of CD8+T cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients (34.4%). More severe patients had lower level of CD4+ T cells and CD+3 T cells (45 [100.0%] vs 29[56.9%], 31 [68.9%] vs 20 [39.2%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and INF-γ, while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1%], 35 [52.2%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF-α was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32 [84.2%] vs 15 [51.7%], 25 [65.8%] vs 10 [34.5%], 17 [44.7%] vs 5 [17.2%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100%). A portion of severe patients (38, 76.0%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0%). Conclusion:Our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality.","510ecab01c66bc2a911abcf67451ec482ed18a05","True","","Background：In January 19, 2020|first|2019|2019-nCoV|Chongqing|China|Methods：In|267|COVID-19|RT-PCR|Chongqing|Jan 19 to Feb 16, 2020|Feb 16, 2020|COVID-19|3|Chongqing|January 19 to February 16, 2020|217|81.27%|50|18.73%|48.0 years|35.0-65.0|129|48.3%|more than 50 years of age|149|55.8%|71.5 years|65.8|43.0 years|32.5-57.0|110|50.7%|39|78.0%|15|30.0%|26|12.0%|41|15.4%|Hubei|139|52.1%|Hubei|COVID-19|225(84.3%|208|77.9%|189|70.8%|136|50.9%|17|34.0%|26|12.0%|10|20.0%|15|6.9%|32|12.0%|20|7.5%|COVID-19|11|5.1%|10|4.6%|118|44.2%|231|86.5%|61|22.8%|77.1 %|45, 100%|53.1%|CD8+T|34.4%|45|100.0%|29[56.9%|31|68.9%|20|39.2%|IL-2|TNF-α|INF-γ|IL-6|IL-17A|COVID-19|47|70.1%|35|52.2%|IL-6|IL-17A|TNF-α|32|84.2%|15|51.7%|25|65.8%|10|34.5%|17|44.7%|5|17.2%|267|100%|38|76.0%|5[10.0%|35[70.0%|12[24.0%|Chinese|43,86.0%|COVID-19|Chongqing|28-day|COVID-19|3|Chongqing|1.5%|Hubei|China|Hubei|ARDS|44.4%|ARDS","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|DATE|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|MONEY|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|NORP|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|PERCENT|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.03.01.20029397","biorxiv_medrxiv"

But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we made the first systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 in order to provide evidence for the control of the COVID-19. Methods: The database from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two evaluators independently selected literature, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. This study is based on the recommendations of PRISMA in Cochrane handbook. Results: A total of 75 COVID-19 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) were obtained. 97.3% of clinical trials were initiated by Chinese organizations. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and all registered clinical trials have not been completed. Most of the trials are early clinical exploratory trials or in pre-experiment stage (only two trials of Remdesivir in Ⅲ stage), and the sample size of subjects recruited is small. The main intervention methods include traditional Chinese medicine treatment, western medicine treatment and integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatment. The subjects were mainly non severe adult patients (≥ 18 years old). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examination. The duration of most trials was more than 5 months, and the median of the intervention study was 180 d (95% CI: 146.3 - 328.9 d); the median of the observation period was 334 d (95% CI: 166.6 - 363.4 d). Overall, both the methodology quality of intervention register trials and observational trials are low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are ongoing or will be carried out in China. However, based on the poor quality and small sample size and long completion period, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment for quite a long time in the future. Improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for the clinical trials of COVID-19 in China.","","False","","2019|COVID-19|China|first|COVID-19|the Chinese Clinical Registration Center|ClinicalTrials.gov|COVID-19|February 9, 2020|Two|PRISMA|Cochrane|75|COVID-19|63|12|97.3%|Chinese|Only 11|only two|Remdesivir|Chinese|Chinese|Western|18 years old|more than 5 months|180|95%|CI|146.3 - 328.9|334|95%|CI|166.6 - 363.4|COVID-19|Chinese|Western|China|COVID-19|COVID-19|China","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|NORP|NORP|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|NORP|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.03.01.20029611",""

Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. Methods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we proved that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. Conclusions: To ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in mainland China apart from Hubei province.","4bc43084ccdb8d3bb704ca577473169cd1a64f9c","True","","December 2019|Wuhan|China|China|China|Hubei|China|Markov|Monte Carlo|Rc|daily|China|Hubei|3.36|95%|CI|3.20-3.64|1|January 31st, 2020|Chinese|China|Hubei|at least less|30%|April, 2020|April|April|China|Hubei","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP|PERSON|PRODUCT|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|NORP|GPE|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.01.20029629","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dyamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31 - February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-province routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, whereas the self-transmission in each province was accelerating over February 4-15. From February 16, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of 2019-nCoV.","5f72fd41d7ba8d4d7de7aa1f83fc5c90ffa50b03","True","","fourth|Coronaviruses|2019-nCoV|Wuhan|Hubei|China|December 2019|VAR|China|January 31 - February 19, 2020|Hubei|February 4|February 4-15|February 16|February 18 and 19|Hubei|Jiangxi|Henan|Anhui|2019-nCoV.","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.01.20029645","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China spreads rapidly since December, 2019. Most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. There is currently no specific medication. The purpose of this study is to to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring. Methods Clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type COVID-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. The relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed. Results A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (CT) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions On admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the elevated IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease exacerbation. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19.","","False","","2019|COVID-19|Wuhan City|China|December, 2019|Methods Clinical|69|56-year|52.17%|79.72%|63.77%|57.97%|50.72%|Diarrhea|CT|60.87%|27.54%|LDH|Two|2.9%|IL-6|CT|Baseline IL-6|LDH|D-dimer|IL-6|COVID-19|30|IL-6|IL-6|CT|25|IL-6|3|COVID-19|LDH|COVID-19|IL-6|IL-6|IL-6|IL-6|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|NORP|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.01.20029769","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The number of cases has increased markedly in Anhui, but information on the clinical characteristics of patients is limited. We reported 75 patients with COVID-19 in the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC from Jan 21 to Feb 16, 2020, Hefei, Anhui Province, China. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR of respiratory nasopharyngeal swab samples. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Of the 75 patients with COVID-19, 61 (81.33%) had a direct or indirect exposure history to Wuhan. Common symptoms at onset included fever (66 [88.0%] of 75 patients) and dry cough (62 [82.67%]). Of the patients without fever, cough could be the only or primary symptom. The most prominent laboratory abnormalities were lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%), decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients with elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed significant decreases in the LYM%, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts. Besides, the percentage of neutrophils, CRP, LDH and Procalcitonin levels increased significantly. We concluded that COVID-19 could cause different degrees of hematological abnormalities and damage of internal organs. Hematological profiles including LYM, LDH, CRP and IL-6 could be indicators of diseases severity and evaluation of treatment effectiveness.

"Alberto Aleta; Yamir Moreno","Evaluation of the potential incidence of COVID-19 and effectiveness of contention measures in Spain: a data-driven approach","Our society is currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. While China - were the outbreak started - seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays being detected in multiple countries. Much is currently unknown about the natural history of the disease, such as a possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. Nonetheless, authorities have to take action and implement contention measures, even if not everything is known. To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work specifically refers to the situation in Spain as of February 28th, 2020, where a few dozens of cases have been detected. We implemented an SEIR-metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which although not efficacious for disease eradication, would produce as a second-order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases","2fe6b550f737baa47a5f2c8ab64cc3d9271c308a","True","","COVID-19|China|Spain|February 28th, 2020|a few dozens|SEIR|the World Health Organization|second|several days","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORDINAL|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.01.20029801","biorxiv_medrxiv"

"Brandon Michael Henry; Maria Helena S Oliveira","Preliminary epidemiological analysis on children and adolescents with novel coronavirus disease 2019 outside Hubei Province, China: an observational study utilizing crowdsourced data","Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to expand across the world. Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients ≤19 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. Results: A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point. The median reporting delay was 3 [IQR: 2-4.8] days. The median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [IQR: 0-3.25] day. In international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in China (p=0.04). When clinical features were reported, fever was the most common presentation (68.0%), followed by cough (36.0%). Conclusions: The number of reported international pediatric COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing. COVID-19 infections are, to-date, more common in males than females in both the children and adolescent age groups. Additionally, this male predominance remains the case both inside and outside of China. Crowdsourced data enabled early analysis of epidemiologic variables in pediatric patients with COVID-19. Further data sharing is required to enable analyses that are required to understand the course of this infection in children.","f8360b0e64d444215d21a61e056b070f12417e53","True","","2019|COVID-19|COVID-19 Methods|two|Pediatric|COVID-19|first|first|Tertiary|Wuhan|82|10|5-15] years|China|Hubei|46.3%|53.7%|52.4%|32.9%|14.6%|China|China|3|2-4.8|first|1|0-3.25|first|2.5 days|China|68.0%|36.0%|China|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|WORK_OF_ART|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERSON","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.01.20029884","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.","d810f78f8850d9386abc6fdd8d652f2f85191753","True","","COVID-19|China|China|China|Wuhan|China|COVID-19|China|Wuhan|China|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.02.20026708","biorxiv_medrxiv"

METHODS: Residual specimens from patients evaluated for acute respiratory illness at hospitals in the Seattle metropolitan area were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses. Transmission models were fit to each virus, with disruption of contact rates and care-seeking informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital admissions. RESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16% to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3% to 9%. Incidence reductions were greatest for viruses that were peaking when the disruption occurred and least for viruses in early epidemic phase.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the severe pneumonia caused by the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China. Method: The study included patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan who had been diagnosed with a pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical features, chronic co-morbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed through electronic medical records. SPSS was used for data analysis to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the patients with the severe pneumonia. Results: A total of 110 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia were included in the study, including 38 with severe pneumonia and 72 with non-severe pneumonia. Statistical analysis showed that advanced age, an increase of D-dimer, and a decrease of lymphocytes were characteristics of the patients with severe pneumonia. Moreover, in the early stage of the disease, chest CT scans of patients with the severe pneumonia showed the illness can progress rapidly. Conclusions: Advanced age, lymphocyte decline, and D-dimer elevation are important characteristics of patients with severe pneumonia.

Influenza epidemics and pandemics cause significant morbidity and mortality. An effective response to a potential pandemic requires the infrastructure to rapidly detect, characterize, and potentially contain new and emerging influenza strains at a population level. The objective of this study is to use data gathered simultaneously from community and hospital sites to develop a model of how influenza enters and spreads in a population. Methods and Analysis. Starting in the 2018-19 season, we have been enrolling individuals with acute respiratory illness from community sites throughout the Seattle metropolitan area, including clinics, childcare facilities, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, workplaces, college campuses, and homeless shelters. At these sites, we collect clinical data and mid-nasal swabs from individuals with at least two acute respiratory symptoms. Additionally, we collect residual nasal swabs and data from individuals who seek care for respiratory symptoms at four regional hospitals. Samples are tested using a multiplex molecular assay, and influenza whole genome sequencing is performed for samples with influenza detected. Geospatial mapping and computational modeling platforms are in development to characterize the regional spread of influenza and other respiratory pathogens. Ethics and Dissemination. The study was approved by the University of Washington's Institutional Review Board. Results will be disseminated through talks at conferences, peer-reviewed publications, and on the study website (www.seattleflu.org).","f82372b109168b411344f537210c63cc6ed323ed","True","","Influenza|Analysis|the 2018-19 season|Seattle|Seattle|Tacoma International Airport|at least two|four|the University of Washington's|Institutional Review Board","medrvix","","","","ORG|NORP|DATE|GPE|GPE|FAC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.02.20029595","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Our previous study has shown that cytokine storm occurred during SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the detailed role of cytokines in the disease severity and progression remained unclear due to the limited case number. In this study, we examined 48 cytokines in the plasma samples from 53 COVID-19 cases, among whom 34 were severe cases, and the others moderate. Results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated upon admission in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1ra were significantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the PaO2/FaO2 and Murray score. Furthermore, the three cytokines were independent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra showed the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) calculations. Serial detection of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra in 14 severe cases showed that the continuous high levels of these cytokines were associated with disease deterioration and fatal outcome. In conclusion, we report three cytokines that closely associated with disease severity and outcome of COVID-19.

"Francesco Di Lauro; István Z Kiss; Joel Miller","The timing of one-shot interventions for epidemic control","The apparent early success in China's large-scale intervention to control the COVID-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when China relaxes the interventions. In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately. We do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. We believe that is a policy question. If an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. Our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain.","c8df44a3612e85e267351e936ddeb8fc5867afa1","True","","China|COVID-19|China|two|one","medrvix","","","","GPE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.02.20030007","biorxiv_medrxiv"

During the interval between February 25-29, 2020, we identified 46 cases of COVID-19 reported in 21 countries in Europe, Africa, North America, and South America which were either in individuals with recent travel from Italy, or who had presumed infection by a traveler from Italy 2. In six cases, in four of the affected countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Croatia), land travel was a likely route of introduction, or was documented to have been the route of introduction. We used air travel volume between Italian cities and cities in other countries as an index of connectedness, using data available from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for February 2015 (2.61 million total departing international air passengers from Italy). We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Italy necessary in order for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk of COVID-19 exposure for travelers departing Italy, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for the proportion of international travelers that are non-residents of Italy (63%) and the average length of stay of tourists to Italy (3.4 days), and assumed the Italian epidemic began one month prior to February 29, 2020. We also performed sensitivity analyses in which we included outbound travel to all countries regardless of reported case importations, inflated travel volumes by 35%, to account for the relative increase in flight numbers from 2015-2019, and excluded cases in bordering countries and which were documented to have been introduced by overland travel. When all cases were considered we estimated a true outbreak size of 3971 cases (95% CI 2907-5297), as compared to a reported case count of 1128 on February 29, 2020, suggesting non-identification of 72% (61-79%) of cases. In sensitivity analyses, outbreak sizes varied from 1552 to 4533 cases (implying non-identification of 27-75% of cases). We recently used similar methods to estimate a much larger epidemic size in Iran, with a far greater degree of under-reporting, based on many fewer exported cases. The reason for this difference relates to the relatively high volume of travel from Italy, relative to Iran. In summary, we suggest that the numerous COVID-19 case exportations from Italy in recent days suggest an epidemic that is larger than official case counts suggest, and which is approximately on a par with that currently occurring in South Korea, which reports 3526 cases (and fewer deaths) as of February 29, 2020.","d0b33d173f1d32662e2ad8d7e85181f9b23f010c","True","","Italy|COVID-19|Lombardy|between February 25-29, 2020|46|21|Europe|Africa|North America|South America|Italy|Italy|2|six|four|Switzerland|France|Austria|Croatia|Italian|the International Air Transport Association|IATA|February 2015|2.61 million|Italy|Fraser|Italy|COVID-19|Italy|the United Nations World Tourism Organization|UNWTO|Italy|63%|Italy|3.4 days|Italian|one month|February 29, 2020|35%|2015-2019|3971|95%|CI|2907-5297|1128|February 29, 2020|72%|61-79%|1552|4533|27-75%|Iran|Italy|Iran|COVID-19|Italy|recent days|South Korea|3526|February 29, 2020","medrvix","","","","GPE|ORG|NORP|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|LOC|LOC|LOC|LOC|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|DATE|NORP|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.02.20030049","biorxiv_medrxiv"

It is highly demanding to estimate how many COVID-19 patients will die eventually. In this study, an estimate of the potential total number of COVID-19 deaths in mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces is provided. The results may help to eluate the severity of the epidemic and facilitate mental health care. Methods: Data of the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths from January 21 to February 29, 2020, released daily by the National Health Commission of China and Hubei Provincial Health Commission, were used. The Boltzmann function was explored to simulate the data in each region. By using these established functions, the potential total number of deaths were forecasted. In addition, data of the cumulative number of 2003 SARS deaths in mainland China, Hong Kong and worldwide were collected from the WHO official website and analyzed in a similar manner. A Monte Carlo technique was applied to analyze the uncertainty of the estimates of the cumulative confirmed cases, and the results are presented using the resulting mean, median, and a 95% confidence interval (CI). For comparison, the potential total numbers of deaths were estimated by Richards function-based regression analyses. Findings: The data of cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths with respect to each region were all well-fitted to the Boltzmann function (R2 for all the regression analyses being close to 0.999). Consistently, the data for the cumulative numbers of 2003 SARS in mainland China, Hong Kong and worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. The potential total number of COVID-19 deaths in mainland China, other provinces, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other cities in Hubei were estimated to be 3260 (95% CI 3187, 3394), 110 (109, 112), 3174 (3095, 3270), 2550 (2494, 2621) and 617 (607, 632), respectively. Similar results were obtained by Richards function-based regression analysis. Interpretation: The observation that the data of the cumulative numbers of deaths for both the on-going COVID-19 outbreak and the 2003 SARS epidemic in each geographic region were well fitted with the Boltzmann function strongly suggests that it is suitable for the simulation of deaths associated with coronaviruses-induced diseases. The estimation of COVID-19 deaths may help governments to evaluate the severity of the outbreak and also facilitate timely mental health care for the families of dead patients.","","False","","2019|China|COVID-19|COVID-19|China|Hubei Province|Wuhan City|COVID-19|January 21 to February 29, 2020|daily|the National Health Commission of China|Hubei Provincial Health Commission|Boltzmann|2003|China|Hong Kong|WHO|A Monte Carlo|95%|CI|Richards|COVID-19|Boltzmann|R2|0.999|2003|China|Hong Kong|Boltzmann function|COVID-19|China|Hubei Province|Wuhan City|Hubei|3260|95%|CI 3187|3394|110|109|112|3174|3095|3270|2550|2494|2621|617|607|632|Richards|COVID-19|2003|Boltzmann|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|ORG|WORK_OF_ART|PERCENT|GPE|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.03.02.20030064","biorxiv_medrxiv"

It is possible to estimate total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities. Methods: We built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation. Findings: From overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu. From separate cities/regions data, we estimated 1059 (95% CI: 918, 1209), 5214 (95% CI: 4659, 5808) as total cases in Wuhan in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different sources of population flow data from Tencent and Baidu. Conclusion: Sources of population follow data and methods impact the estimates of local cases in Wuhan before city lock down.

Real- time fluorescent PCR (RT-PCR) is the clinical standard for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection. To detect SARS-CoV-2 early and control the disease spreading on time, a faster and more convenient method for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detecting, RT-LAMP method (reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification) was developed. RNA reverse transcription and nucleic acid amplification were performed in one step at 63 ℃ isothermal conditions, and the results can be obtained within 30 minutes. ORF1ab gene, E gene and N gene were detected at the same time. ORF1ab gene was very specific and N gene was very sensitivity, so they can guarantee both sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP assay is similar to RT-PCR, and specificity was 99% as detecting 208 clinical specimens. The RT-LAMP assay reported here has the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation, and easy detection, which is useful for the rapid and reliable clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.","267729947ca478946d5a4bffb8e13d50c3545120","True","","COVID-19|RT-PCR|RT-LAMP|RNA|one|63|℃|30 minutes|RT-LAMP|RT-PCR|99%|208|The RT-LAMP","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|TIME|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-02","","10.1101/2020.03.02.20030130","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature ≥37.3C. Results: We enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and -0.96 to -0.61C for the wrist measurements. Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P <0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P <0.001). The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature ≥37.3C was 36.2C with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity. Conclusions: Wrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different circumstance. Both measurements have great fever screening abilities for indoor patients.

The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. Methods A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. Findings Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p < 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006). Interpretation The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","ff067164497bcfbd9145be223dcd2b05f159dd63","True","","173|535|Ab|IgM|IgG|173|Ab|IgM|IgG|93.1%|161/173|82.7%|143/173|64.7%|Twelve|Ab|IgM|IgG|11|12|14 days|40%|the first 7 days|100.0%|94.3%|79.8%|Ab|IgM|IgG|day 15|RNA|66.7%|58/87|before day 7|45.5%|25/55|days 15 to 39|Combining RNA|COVID-19|0.001|1-week|0.007|Ab|0.006|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-03","","10.1101/2020.03.02.20030189","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Marissa G Baker; Trevor K Peckham; Noah S. Seixas","Estimating the burden of United States workers exposed to infection or disease: a key factor in containing risk of COVID-19 infection","Introduction: With the global spread of COVID-19, there is a compelling public health interest in quantifying who is at increased risk of disease. Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Understanding which occupational groups are exposed to infection and disease in the workplace can help to inform public health risk response and management for COVID-19, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: To estimate the burden of United States workers exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations with particular physical, ergonomic, and structural exposures. For this analysis, occupations reporting exposure to infection or disease more than once a month was the focus. Results: Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). Conclusions: The large number of persons employed in a wide variety of occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. This work also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.","","False","","COVID-19|Occupational|close quarters|COVID-19|United States|Standard Occupational Classification|the Bureau of Labor Statistics|BLS|approximately 10%|14.4 M)|United States|Approximately 18.4%|26.7 M|United States|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|MONEY|GPE|PERCENT|MONEY|GPE|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.02.20030288","biorxiv_medrxiv"

More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease. Objectives: To study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: we performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital. Measurements and Main Results: The median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. Methods The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 32 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.","3a73b880acd8983f87b210ff7fee434fd6ecc8c8","True","","Wuhan|Shenzhen|China|Shenzhen|CDC|391|January 14 to February 12, 2020 and|1286|Findings Cases|age 45|187|204|Ninety-one percent|Three|225|32 days|4.6 days|1.9 days|Household|6|7|15%|0.4|6.3 days|R.","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|NORP","medrxiv","2020-03-04","","10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. Methods: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across China. The model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. Results: We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, R2=0.86) with reported incidence. Without NPIs, the number of COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 - 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. If NPIs could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across China, respectively. Results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on February 17, 2020. Conclusion: The NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World.","","False","","COVID-19|China|the World.|SEIR|China|Wuhan|daily|first|Baidu|China|daily|114,325|76,776|China|February 29, 2020|p<0.001|COVID-19|67-fold|44 - 94|one week|two weeks|three weeks earlier|China|66%|86%|95%|one week|two weeks|three weeks later|3-fold|7-fold|18-fold|China|the next few months|China|February 17, 2020|China|COVID-19|NPI|World","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.03.20029843",""

Conclusions: Estimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring. Shorter serial intervals lead to lower estimates of R0, which suggest that half of all secondary infections should be prevented to control spread.","3028628066ec2401f3981f4e70c5b1acd4cef573","True","","COVID-19|Singapore|Tianjin|Singapore|Tianjin|China|Jan.19-Feb.26|Jan.21-Feb.27|7.1|6.13|8.25|Singapore|9|7.92|10.2)days|Tianjin|4.56|2.69|6.42|Singapore|4.22|3.43|5.01|Tianjin|2.55|2.89days|Singapore|Tianjin|Singapore|1.97|2.48|Tianjin|1.87|Singapore|Tianjin|R0|half","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|FAC|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.03.20029983","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We aim to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patient with COVID-19 in Hunan which is adjacent to Hubei. Methods: In this double-center, observational study, we recruited all consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from January 23 to February 14, 2020 in two designated hospitals in Hunan province, China. Epidemiological and clinical data from patients' electronic medical records were collected and compared between mild, moderate and severe/critical group in detail. Clinical outcomes were followed up to February 20, 2020. Findings: 291 patients with COVID-19 were categorized into mild group (10.0%), moderate group (72.8%) and severe/critical group (17.2%). The median age of all patients was 46 years (49.8% were male). 86.6% patients had an indirect exposure history. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group (48.0% vs 17.2%, p=0.006) and moderate group (43.4% vs 17.2%, p=0.007) were higher than mild group. Fever (68.7%), cough (60.5%), and fatigue (31.6%) were common symptoms especially for severe and critical patients. Typical lung imaging finding were bilateral and unilateral ground glass opacity or consolidation. Leukopenia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia occurred in 36.1%, 22.7% and 50.2% patients respectively. Increased fibrinogen was detected in 45 of 58 (77.6%) patients with available results. 29 of 44 (65.9%) or 22 of 40 (55.0%) patients were positive in Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia antibody test respectively. Compared with mild or moderate group, severe/critical group had a relative higher level of neutrophil, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, h-CRP, ESR, CK, CK-MB, LDH, D-dimer, and a lower level of lymphocyte, eosinophils, platelet, HDL and sodium (all p<0.01). Most patients received antiviral therapy and Chinese Medicine therapy. As of February 20, 2020, 159 (54.6%) patients were discharged and 2 (0.7%) patients died during hospitalization. The median length of hospital stay in discharged patients was 12 days (IQR: 10-15). Interpretation: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Hunan is different from patients in Wuhan. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group and moderate group were higher than mild group. Laboratory and imaging examination can assist in the diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 patients.","462cbb326ccd8587cae7a3538c8c6712d9013698","True","","COVID-19|Hubei|COVID-19|Hunan|Hubei|January 23 to February 14, 2020|two|Hunan|China|up to February 20, 2020|291|COVID-19|10.0%|72.8%|17.2%|46 years|49.8%|86.6%|Wuhan|48.0%|17.2%|p=0.006|43.4% vs|17.2%|68.7%|60.5%|31.6%|Leukopenia|36.1%|22.7%|50.2%|45|58|77.6%|29|44|65.9%|22 of 40|55.0%|Mycoplasma|Chlamydia|neutrophil|Neutrophil|Lymphocyte Ratio|ESR|CK|CK-MB|LDH|HDL|Chinese Medicine|February 20, 2020|159|54.6%|2|0.7%|12 days|10-15|COVID-19|Hunan|Wuhan|Wuhan|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.03.20030353","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Suboptimal T and B cell responses can delay viral clearance in MERS and SARS patients. The role of leukomonocytes in viral clearance of COVID-19 patients is not yet well defined.Methods: From January 26 to February 28, 2020, an observational study was launched at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We enrolled 25 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, whose throat-swab specimens were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR. We comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells in the patients who successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days. Findings: In 25 enrolled COVID-19 patients, lymphopeniawas a common feature. After the treatment, 14 patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patients that cleared the infection had restored the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cellsand B cells as compared to the still viral RNA positive patients, while the recovered patients had a higher count of leukomonocytes. Conclusions: By comparison of leukomonocytes counts in COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease, we found that CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B cells appear to play important roles in viral clearance. The restoration of leukomonocytes counts from peripheral blood can be used as prognosis for the recovery of an COVID-19 infection. We propose that restoration of leukomonocytes counts can be added to the COVID-19 diagnostic guidanceas a criterion for releasing and discharging patients.","e560eb28bb3f35099d2632f80adaa14436516474","True","","one|Suboptimal|COVID-19|January 26 to February 28, 2020|Zhongnan Hospital|Wuhan University|Wuhan|China|25|COVID-19|8-14 days|25|COVID-19|14|RNA|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE|FAC|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.03.20030437","biorxiv_medrxiv"

By the end of February 2020, the epidemic outside Hubei province in China has been well controlled, yet the next wave of transmission in other countries may have just begun. A retrospective modeling of the transmission dynamics would provide insights into the epidemiological characteristics of the disease and evaluation of the effectiveness of the strict measures that have been taken by central and local governments of China. Using a refined susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission model and a new strategy of model fitting, we were able to estimate model parameters in a dynamic manner. The resulting parameter estimation can well reflect the prevention policy scenarios. Our simulation results with different degrees of government control suggest that the strictly enforced quarantine and travel ban have significantly decreased the otherwise uncontrollable spread of the disease. Our results suggest similar measures should be considered by other countries that are of high risk of COVID-19 outbreak.","","False","","2019|COVID-19|first|Wuhan|China|December 2019|China|the end of February 2020|Hubei|China|China|SEIR|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.03.20030445","biorxiv_medrxiv"

METHODS Individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11, January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. RESULTS The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age <20) whose attack rate continued to increase. Healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age. The effective reproductive number dropped from 3.86 (95% credible interval 3.74 to 3.97) before interventions to 0.32 (0.28 to 0.37) post interventions. The interventions were estimated to prevent 94.5% (93.7 to 95.2%) infections till February 18. We found that at least 59% of infected cases were unascertained in Wuhan, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS Considerable countermeasures have effectively controlled the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Special efforts are needed to protect vulnerable populations, including healthcare workers, elderly and children. Estimation of unascertained cases has important implications on continuing surveillance and interventions.","9701a8c529cd8c18124da4cd61c1165a64b50281","True","","2019|Covid-19|Wuhan|China|25,961|Covid-19|February 18, 2020|Notifiable Disease Report System|four|January 11, January 11-22|January 23 - February 1|February 2-18|57 years|50.3%|third|Healthcare|3.86|95%|3.74|3.97|0.32|0.28|94.5%|93.7|95.2%|February 18|at least 59%|Wuhan|CONCLUSIONS Considerable|Covid-19|Wuhan","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|ORDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|PERSON|ORG|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Although its basic clinical features have been reported, the dynamic characteristics of immune system in COVID-2019 patients, especially those critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, are not yet well understood. We aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels, and the changes of gut microbes of COVID-2019 patient. Methods This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, a COVID-2019 designated hospital in Wuhan, from January 31 to February 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed and classified based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China4. We recorded the epidemiological history, demographic features, clinical characteristics, symptoms and signs, treatment and clinical outcome in detail. Blood samples were collected and we determined the expression levels of immune cells (CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD16+56+ NK cells) in different time points. Nanopore Targeted Sequencing was used to determine the alterations of gut microbiota homeostasis. Results Apart from the clinical features described previously4, we found that four patients had decreased immune cells and refractory hypoxemia during the hospitalization, and the severity of hypoxemia was strongly correlated to the expression levels of immune cells. Additionally, we found that the proportion of probiotics was significantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, and the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes. Notably, all patients died. Conclusions We discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and the imbalance of gut microbiota in 3 critical patients with COVID-2019. Hypoxemia severity was closely related with host immune cell levels, and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which revealing that immunodepletion with refractory hypoxemia is a potential high risk subtype of COVID-2019 and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut dysbiosis may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia.","594d23a412649df7dbfef5347a2a0c208ed4417d","True","","3|3|2019-nCoV|Renmin Hospital|Wuhan University|Wuhan|January 31 to February 6, 2020|Diagnosis|Pneumonia|6th|the National Health Commission of China4|Nanopore Targeted Sequencing|four|Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium|Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria|3|first","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|DATE|PERSON|GPE|ORDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.03.20030650","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The mortality of critical illness was high in Wuhan. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province. Methods In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments, and prognosis were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. Results Forty-five critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 ICUs in Guangdong Province. The mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were high fever and cough. Majority of patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all the patients. Thirty-seven patients (82.2%) had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 13 (28.9%) septic shock.

We aimed to report several changes in the clinical characteristics at admission of patients with COVID-19. Methods Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness. Results Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23. Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24). Conclusions The initial symptoms of recently infected patients seem more insidious, indicating that the new coronavirus may gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza and latent in asymptomatic carriers for a long time.","0ab795fc615df6457551a8e231dce1f268eef9d2","True","","4rd|2019|COVID-19|Methods Clinical|COVID-19|89|31|34.8%|January 16 to 22|58|65.2%|January 23 to 29|21|67.7%|31|13|41.9%|31|7|22.6%|31|January 23|10|32.3%|31|January 23|4|6.9%|58|January 23|two|January 23|13|54.2%|24|CD3|11|54.4%|21|CD8|9 [42.9%|21|SAA|18|75%|24","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERSON|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.03.20030833","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Zhou Tang; Xianbin Li; Houqiang Li","Prediction of New Coronavirus Infection Based on a Modified SEIR Model","BACKGROUND The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in December 2019, poses a huge threat to China and even global public health security. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness. The transmission of the new coronavirus no longer meets the basic assumptions of the classical kinetic system. Therefore, this article first establishes a modified SEIR model. Predict and analyze the changing trend of the epidemic situation, then estimate the parameters involved in the infection dynamics model, and then use Matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations based on public data and analyze the results. Recommendations for universal prevention and control of infectious diseases. RESULTS The first case of new coronavirus infection was confirmed in Wuhan on December 8, 2019. When Wuhan City took no action, assuming the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 5, the number of infected persons will reach about 2,384,803 people; If wuhan adopts the measures of sealing the city on January 22, 2020, under the premise of k=2, the number of infected people decreases by 19,773 compared with that on January 23, and there is no significant change in the time when the number of infected people reaches the peak. Under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on January 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. If Wuhan City is closed for one day, the number of infected persons will increase from 106,145 to 130,626 under the premise of k = 2; the number of infected persons will increase from 74,369 to 92,010 under the premise of k = 1. CONCLUSIONS Comparing the number of confirmed diagnoses actually notified by the department with the number of infected people obtained from the simulation of the model, it can be seen that the city closure measures adopted by the Wuhan Municipal Government on January 23 and the first-level response measures adopted by the country are effective for the epidemic Prevention and control play a vital role. Wearing a mask when going out and avoiding close contact with people can effectively reduce the infection rate.","5bb89950ec5a06e2b7f69b2a9c4213dda19b1ab0","True","","Wuhan City, Hubei Province|December 2019|China|the Spring Festival|the Chinese Spring Festival|SEIR|first|SEIR|Predict|Matlab|first|Wuhan|December 8, 2019|Wuhan City|5|about 2,384,803|January 22, 2020|19,773|January 23|1|14,330|January 23|2 days|Wuhan City|one day|106,145|130,626|2|74,369|92,010|1|the Wuhan Municipal Government|January 23|first","medrvix","","","","GPE|DATE|GPE|EVENT|EVENT|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|PERSON|PRODUCT|ORDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.03.20030858","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This study is aimed to investigate the risk perception and immediate psychological state of HCWs in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods This study utilized a cross-sectional survey designed on a convenient sample of 4357 HCWs in China. Its data were collected using anonymous structured questionnaires distributed through social software. 6 questions were set to evaluate the participants' risk perception of COVID-19, and a General Health Questionnaire was used to identify the participants' immediate psychological status. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Risk perception and psychological status were compared by demographic characteristics and COVID-19 exposure experiences. Result A total of 4,600 questionnaires were distributed, and 4,357 qualified ones (94.7%) were collected. The main concerns of HCWs are: infection of colleagues (72.5%), infection of family members (63.9%), protective measures (52.3%) and medical violence (48.5%). And 39.1% of the HCWs had psychological distress, especially working in Wuhan, participating in frontline treatments, having been isolated and having family members or colleagues infected. Conclusions The finding indicating that, faced with the COVID-19 epidemic, HCWs, especially in Wuhan, were worried about the risks of infection and protective measures, resulting in psychological distress, so further actions should be taken.","","False","","2019|COVID-19|more than 3000|2|China|COVID-19|4357|China|6|COVID-19|General Health Questionnaire|4,600|4,357|94.7%|72.5%|63.9%|52.3%|48.5%|39.1%|Wuhan|COVID-19|Wuhan","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.03.20030874","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness. Methods: Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 12, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, medication therapy and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Patients were confirmed by PCR test. Results: Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases and 56 (53.85%) were indigenous cases; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. Family clusters were the major body of patients. Transmission along the chain of 3 &ldquo:generations” was observed.

COVID-19 diagnosis relies upon nucleic acid detection; however, current recommended methods exhibit high false-negative rates, low sensitivity, and cannot identify other respiratory virus infections, thereby resulting patient misdiagnosis and impeding epidemic containment. Combining the advantages of target amplification and long-read, real-time nanopore sequencing, we developed nanopore target sequencing (NTS) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses simultaneously within 6-10 h. Parallel testing with approved qPCR kits of SARS-CoV-2 and NTS using 61 nucleic acid samples from suspected COVID-19 cases confirmed that NTS identified more infected patients as positive, and could also monitor for mutated nucleic acid sequence or other respiratory virus infection in the test sample. NTS is thus suitable for contemporary COVID-19 diagnosis; moreover, this platform can be further extended for diagnosing other viruses or pathogens.","3deb6393bd43f440a69c84da9ed61986b1781d36","True","","Wuhan|China|NTS|6-10|Parallel|NTS|61|NTS|NTS|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|ORG|QUANTITY|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.04.20029538","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Here we identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in Shanghai. Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Results: Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction.

Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group. Method We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases. Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients. Conclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.","","False","","2019|COVID-19|China|COVID-19|China|Method|December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020|CFR|12,863|Hubei|9,651|62|1,449|77|39 years|p<0.001|58%|36/62|1.18|95%CI|1.14|1.22|2.02|1.02|4.03|West|Northeast|East|3.93|1.74|8.85|CFR|0.89-1.24%|2-fold|24-fold|CFR|Hubei|COVID-19|Middle East|2009|COVID-19|COVID-19|China","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|LOC|LOC|LOC|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|ORG|LOC|DATE|ORG|ORG|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.04.20031005","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Few studies focused on clinical characteristics non-survivors hospitalized with COVID-19. Objectives: We aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of died patients with COVID-19 and tracked the causes of the rapid disease progression and death. Methods: 101 non-surviving patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Clinical data were collected and compared between non-survivors who died within 3 days and after 3 days of admission. Multivariable regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors associated with rapid disease progression and death. Measurements and Main Results: Among included patients, median age was 71 years (IQR, 59-80), 60 (59.41%) were men. 82 (81.19%) had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (59 [58.42%]), diabetes (22 [21.78%]) etc. 100 (99.01%) suffered respiratory failure, 53 (52.48%) developed acute cardiac injury, acute kidney and liver injury occurred in 23 (22.77%) and 18 (17.82%) patients, respectively.

BACKGROUND During epidemic period, chest computed tomography (CT) has been highly recommended for screening patients with suspected COVID-19. However, the comparison of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia has not been fully elucidated. METHODS Patients with heart failure (n=12), COVID-19 pneumonia (n=12) and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed. RESULTS There was no difference of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lobes affected and septal thickening between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. However, less rounded morphology (8.3% vs. 67%, p=0.003), more peribronchovascular thickening (75% vs. 33%, p=0.041) and fissural thickening (33% vs. 0%, p=0.028), less peripheral distribution (33% vs. 92%, p=0.003) were found in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group. Importantly, there were also more patients with upper pulmonary vein enlargement (75% vs. 8.3%, p=0.001), subpleural effusion and cardiac enlargement in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group (50% vs. 0%, p=0.005, separately). Besides, more fibrous lesions were found in COVID-19 group although there was no statistical difference (25% vs. 0%, P=0.064) CONCLUSIONS Although there are some overlaps of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19, CT is still a useful tool in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia.","f47af9fe364fd9bac5e061142208d801667c5aca","True","","CT|Corona Virus Disease|2019|COVID-19|CT|CT|COVID-19|METHODS Patients|COVID-19|one|CT|GGO|COVID-19|8.3%|67%|p=0.003|75%|33%|33%|0%|33%|92%|p=0.003|COVID-19|75%|8.3%|COVID-19|50%|0%|p=0.005|COVID-19|25%|0%|P=0.064|CONCLUSIONS|CT|COVID-19|CT|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|FAC|DATE|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.04.20031047","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","734779fad93249a2f6fede6afd10eeff7b37919b","True","","coming years|the United States|HCoV|HCoV|the year 2025","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), plasma creatinine, and urea concentrations along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. Kidney tissues from six other patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Among these 85 COVID-19 cases, 27.06% (23/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF), and elder patients (≥ 60 years old) are easier to develop ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001). Comorbidities of disorders like hypertension and heart failure were more common in patients who developed ARF (69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001). Dynamic observation of eGFR revealed that perished cases have a rapid decrease of eGFR but quickly boosting plasma creatinine and urea. On the other hand, enhancement of eGFR and persistence low level of plasma creatinine and urea was observed in recovery patients following diuretic treatment. H&E staining demonstrated kidney tissues from 6 cases of postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis but no evidence of glomerular pathology or tubulointerstitial lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules. CONCLUSIONS The development of ARF during the course of disease is an important negative prognostic indicator for survival with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 virus directly infects human kidney tubules by thus induces acute tubular damage, ARF and probably also lead to urine transmission.","","False","","2019|COVID-19|2|85|COVID-19|Wuhan|January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020|Kidney|six|Hematoxylin|Eosin|H&E|NP|85|27.06%|23/85|ARF|≥|60 years old|ARF|65.22%|24.19%|0.001|ARF|69.57%|11.29%|0.001|H&E|6|NP|ARF|COVID-19|ARF","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.04.20031120",""

We developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered (SEIQR) models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown. Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56~1.76). We found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland China. The number of infections could be reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of Feb 23, 2020. However, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect. Because it would cause in situ deteriorating, which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter. To minimize the epidemic size and death, stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective.","f40eaec892778166e4f8f8eeb576893e82a591be","True","","2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|daily|daily|daily|Jan 01, 2020|380.1|379.8~381.0|30 days|Wuhan|Hubei|2.2|1.4~3.9|2.56|2.43~2.63|1.65|1.56~1.76|China|98.9%|99.3%|Feb 23, 2020","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-06","","10.1101/2020.03.04.20031187","biorxiv_medrxiv"

While seasonal influenza and other respiratory pathogens cause significant morbidity and mortality each year, the community-based burden of these infections remains incompletely understood. Understanding the prevalence, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics of respiratory pathogen infections among community-dwelling individuals is essential during pandemic and epidemic settings and for developing pandemic-preparedness infrastructure. Methods and Analysis. We present the protocol for a novel, city-wide home-based cross-sectional study in the Seattle Metropolitan area, utilizing rapid delivery systems for self-collection of a nasal swab and return to the laboratory for respiratory pathogen testing. All participation takes place electronically, including recruitment, consent, and data collection. Within 48 hours of participants self-reporting respiratory symptoms, a nasal swab kit is delivered to the household via a courier service. Demographic and illness characteristics are collected at the time of sample collection and recovery and behavioral information collected one week later. Specimens are tested in the laboratory for multiple respiratory pathogens, and results are available on a public website for participants. Ethics and Dissemination. The study was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (Protocol #00006181). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, talks at conferences, and on the Study Website (www.seattleflu.org).","bfed3ce6a6df2d442d96d0cab07d4bc1f2347255","True","","each year|Seattle Metropolitan|48 hours|Demographic|one week later|Specimens|the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (Protocol #00006181|the Study Website","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|TIME|PERSON|DATE|ORG|ORG|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-07","","10.1101/2020.03.04.20031211","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Shitao Rao; Alexandria Lau; Hon-Cheong So","Exploring diseases/traits and blood proteins causally related to expression of ACE2, the putative receptor of 2019-nCov: A Mendelian Randomization analysis","The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has caused major outbreaks in many parts of the world. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for 2019-nCoV, and studies also suggested that high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression in the lung. Expression data was based on GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, MR is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. The most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest GWAS on type II diabetes (T2DM) to date (N=898,130), we found that T2DM is causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (beta=0.1835, 95% CI 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.49E-4; GSMR method). Significant associations (at nominal level; p<0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type I and II diabetes. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased ACE2 included inflammatory bowel disease, (ER+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated ALT, among others. We also uncovered a number of plasma/serum proteins potentially linked to altered ACE2 expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling, JAK-STAT signaling etc. We also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the MR analysis. In conclusion, the current MR analysis reveals diseases/traits and blood proteins that may causally affect ACE2 expression, which in turn may influence susceptibility to the infection. The proteome-wide MR analysis may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression, and may help guide drug repositioning in the future. Nevertheless, we stress that further studies are required to verify our findings due to various limitations and the exploratory nature of some analyses.","b696d208705fcb1925693c5f0d118733bb557ea6","True","","2019-nCoV|COVID-19|ACE2|2019-nCoV|ACE2|Mendelian|one|GWAS|N=898,130|beta=0.1835|95%|CI|0.0853-0.2817|p=2.49E-4|GSMR|ALT|VEGF|JAK-STAT","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.04.20031237","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week. Conclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.","9bbfd3d34ee18ea1b9f4669331a6cee9c5992893","True","","2019|COVID-19|RT-PCR|nine|Seven|two|RT-PCR|days 1-5|100%|6.76x10E5|the first 5 days|the first week|RNA|RNA|about one week|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502","biorxiv_medrxiv"

To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts.","c8c052d27aaf8015316dcd2644fa5e0b3870cea1","True","","Coronavirus Disease 2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|two|COVID-19|4.8 days|at least three-quarters|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.05.20031088","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I2-statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result. Results: According to the combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients were males. The mean age of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). Two prevalent clinical symptoms between patients were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively.

However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged >60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p<0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Cardiac complications are common in COVID-19 patients. Elevated CRP levels, underlying comorbidities, and NCP severity are the main risk factors for cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients.","114ed64f52f503d9d2e2ba1fd1ee62b0a168cd84","True","","the Coronavirus Disease 2019|China|AMI|COVID-19|COVID-19|AMI|AMI|53|COVID-19|28|25|19-81 years|42|53|79.25%|n=15|AMI|six|AMI|60 years|five|two|NCP|AMI|AMI|p<0.001|AMI|three|two|Multivariate|NCP|COVID-19|COVID-19|NCP|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.05.20031591","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in China. To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions.

Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Conclusions: Estimating generation and serial interval distributions from outbreak data requires careful investigation of the underlying transmission network. Detailed contact tracing information is essential for correctly estimating these quantities.","af266fac8970a7960e96630a67d91bec5dda0335","True","","COVID-19|COVID-19|Singapore|Tianjin|China|5.20|95%CI|3.78-6.78|Singapore|3.95|95%CI|3.01-4.91|days|Tianjin|China|5.2|2.8 days|48%|32-67%|Singapore|62%|50-76%|Tianjin|China","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.05.20031815","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model. Methods: An age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: <= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: >= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: <= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: >= 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR). Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups (χ2 = 4.99 × 10-6, P > 0.999), and five age groups (χ2 = 4.85 × 10-6, P > 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people.","a0ecc9b46addbc1faab491434b5331702f7883b8","True","","December 2019|China|two|Wuhan City|1|4|1|14 years|2|15-44 years|3|45-64 years|4|65 years|5|1|5 years|2|6|14 years|3|15-24 years|4|25-59 years|4|60 years|26 November to 22 December, 2019|Wuhan City|China|four|4.99 × 10-6|0.999|five|4.85 × 10-6|0.999|four-age-group|2|3|17.56|10 million|3|10.17|10 million|1|0.002|10 million|five-age-group|4|5|12.40|10 million|5|4|6.61|10 million|3 to 4|0.0002|10 million","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.05.20031849","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak. In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with adjusted R square above 0.75 were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using alpha=0.05. Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere. A 20oC increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects.","b4edd81e0d2770b0d6e0e3c93c7fffc43e3caa80","True","","COVID-19|four|China|4|between January 23 and March 1|39 days|31|Mainland China|more than one|Two|12|15 days|3|5|0.75|alpha=0.05|COVID-19|spring|summer|20oC|1.8 days|18%|the remaining|82%","medrvix","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.05.20031872","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. Methods: This study conducted an online questionnaire survey from February 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in Anhui Province. This study used a modified Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale. Results: The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban participants. The closer COVID-19 is to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger. Compared with Nursing college students, nurses have stronger emotional responses and are more willing to use Problem-focused coping. People may have a cycle of "the more fear, the more problem-focused coping". And people may "The more angry, the more emotion-focused coping", "the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious, the more angry, the more sadness". Conclusion: COVID-19 is a pressure source with great influence, both for individuals and for the social public groups. Different individuals and groups may experience different levels of psychological crisis, and those nurses at the core of the incident are affected. Hospitals should focus on providing psychological support to nurses and providing timely psychological assistance and training in coping strategies.

Effective screening for patients is important to limit the epidemic. However, some defects make the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning of patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening of highly suspected patients using easy-to-get variables. METHODS A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into COVID-19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for model validation. RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID-19 early warning score (COVID-19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.935-0.977, P < 0.001]; validation dataset 0.960 [95%CI 0.919-1.0, P < 0.001] ) and COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.934-0.978, P < 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95%CI 0.929-1, P < 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut-off values of disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8+ T cell count, CD4+ T cell count, and so on. CONCLUSIONS The new developed COVID-19 EWS was a considerable tool for early and relatively accurately warning of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.","5129bb31949c66ebd544658c531004046d4102da","True","","COVID-19|METHODS|1,311|2|COVID-19|Multivariate|ROC|CT|Tmax|COVID-19|COVID-19|EWS|ROC|AUROC|0.001|0.960|0.919-1.0|0.001|0.956|95%CI|0.934|0.001|0.966|95%CI|0.929-1|0.001|CT|COVID-19 EWS","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|PERSON","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.05.20031906","biorxiv_medrxiv"

SENSR consists of two simple enzymatic reactions: a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that induces fluorescence. Here, we demonstrate that SENSR is an effective and highly sensitive method for the detection of the current epidemic pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the influencing factors on medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff from 10th February 2020 to 20th February 2020 in China using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, using the criteria of normal (≤49), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety (≥70). We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g., having direct contact treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. Results: Of 512 medical staff from China, 164 healthcare workers (32.03%) had had direct contact by treating infected patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers from moderate (1.36%) and four workers from severe anxiety (0.78%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients saw higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact (βvalue=2.33, CI: 0.65 -4.00; p=0.0068). Similar things were observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China (βvalue=3.67, CI: 1.44 -5.89; p=0.0013). The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases (βvalue=4.44, CI: 1.55 -7.33; p=0.0028). Conclusion: Our results highlight that government authorities should make early detection of the high risk of anxiety among medical staff a priority, and implement appropriate psychological intervention programs, to prevent medical staff from developing psychological disorders that could potentially exert an adverse effect on combating the COVID-19 epidemic.","","False","","COVID-19|China|December 2019|China|COVID-19|10th February 2020|20th|February 2020|China|the Zung Self-rating|SAS|50-59|60-70|Hubei|512|China|164|32.03%|12.5%|53|10.35%|seven|1.36%|four|0.78%|CI|0.65|Hubei|China|CI|1.44|CI|1.55 -7.33|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|DATE|GPE|ORG|DATE|ORDINAL|DATE|GPE|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.05.20032003","biorxiv_medrxiv"

"Mark Hernandez; Lauren E Milechin; Shakti K Davis; Rich DeLaura; Kajal T Claypool; Albert Swiston","The Impact of Host-Based Early Warning on Disease Outbreaks","Objective: The detection of communicable pathogens responsible for major outbreaks relies on health care professionals recognition of symptoms manifesting in infectious individuals. Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. Methods: We extend the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: Self-monitoring and reporting (baseline SEIR model), Quarantining the entire population, Quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), Quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and Quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). We further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. Results: For all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori. Conclusions: Our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. Our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation.","dd2cd004a197872cfce1c31a9685d6972f838efa","True","","SEIR|Susceptible|Exposed|Infectious|five|SEIR|Quarantine-on|Quarantine-on-alert|Quarantine-on-alert|five|four","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|NORP|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.06.20029793","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, were volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status of fMW. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>7 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS and prevalence of sleep disturbances between fMW and non-fMW. Subgroup analysis for different gender in fMW was conducted. Results A total of 1306 subjects (including 801 fMW and 505 non-fMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-fMW, fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3 vs 7.5, P＜0.001), AIS (6.9 vs 5.3, P＜0.001), anxiety (4.9 vs 4.3, P＜0.001) and depression (4.1 vs 3.6, P=0.001), and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (67.2% vs 47.7%, P＜0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%, P＜0.001). In subgroup analysis, compared to male fMW, female fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.4 vs 8.6, P=0.022) and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (70.3% vs 54.6%, P<0.001).

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 6 to February 14, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab specimens. Findings Of the 238 patients, 194 (81.5%) were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, which was significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibody between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85) whose nucleic acid tests were negative. After the patients were defined to the different stages of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected, the analysis results showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. In addition, half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive. Interpretation The suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection.

McGovern","Estimating the scale of COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States: Simulations Based on Air Traffic directly from Wuhan, China","Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been characterized by rapid spread and unusually large case clusters. It is important to have an estimate of the current state of COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. to develop informed public health strategies. Methods: We estimated the potential scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (as of 03/01/2020) in the U.S. from cases imported directly from Wuhan area. We used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from Wuhan to the U.S and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions. Detection and quarantine of individual COVID-19 cases in the U.S before 03/01/2020 were also taken into account. We. A SEIR model was used to simulate the growth of the number of infected individuals in Wuhan area and in the U.S. Results: With the most likely model, we estimated that there would be 9,484 infected cases (90%CI 2,054-24,241) as of 03/01/2020 if no intervention procedure had been taken to reduce the transmissibility in unidentified cases. Assuming current preventive procedures have reduced 25% of the transmissibility in unidentified cases, the number of infected cases would be 1,043 (90%CI 107-2,474). Conclusion: Our research indicates that, as of 03/01/2020., it is likely that there are already thousands of individuals in the US infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our model is dynamic and is available to the research community to further evaluate as the situation becomes clearer.","","False","","COVID-19|U.S.|COVID-19|U.S.|Wuhan|Wuhan|U.S|COVID-19|U.S|03/01/2020|SEIR|Wuhan|U.S.|9,484|90%CI|2,054-24,241|03/01/2020|25%|1,043|90%CI|107-2,474|03/01/2020|thousands|US","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.06.20031880","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This study evaluated whether and when the infected but asymptomatic cases during the incubation period could infect others. Methods: We collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the Chinese local authorities. We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset. Results: The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1±3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. The infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first-generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period. Conclusions: The results indicated the transmission of COVID-9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole. Strong and effective countermeasures should be implemented to prevent or mitigate asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period in populations at high risk.","fd96fc1859201e13e35526c188e022fa6e335327","True","","2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|onset day|Chinese|50|124|first|COVID-19|4.9 days|95%|CI|4.4|0.8 to 11.1 days|2.5th|97.5th|SD|4.1±3.3 days|2.5th|97.5th|-1|13 days|73.0%|first|the last three days|COVID-9","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|PERSON|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|FAC|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|LANGUAGE|FAC|ORG|DATE|PERCENT|ORDINAL|DATE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.06.20031955","biorxiv_medrxiv"

There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date.

We used reported data from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 23, 2020, fitted the model of infection, and on the number of cases reported to estimate likely number of infections in four high risk metropolitan areas, as well as facilitate understanding the COVID-19's spread pattern. A group of SERI model statistical parameters were estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and our modeling integrated the effect of the official quarantine regulation and travel restriction of China. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number R0 ​is 3.11 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen. In addition, we inferred the prediction results and compared the results of different level of parameters, For example, In Beijing, the predicated peak number of cases is around 466 at the peak time Feb 29, 2020; however, when the city conducts different levels (strict, mild, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the estimation results show that transmission dynamics will change and the peek number of cases shows the changing proportion is between 56%~159%. We concluded that public health interventions would reduce the risks of COVID-19 spreading and more rigorous control and prevention measures will effectively contain its further spread, but risk increases when businesses and social activities returning back before the ending date. Besides, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China are potential to provide evidences supporting for other metropolitan areas and big cities with emerging cases outside China.","","False","","COVID-19|China|Wuhan|Jan 24, 2020,|Feb 23, 2020|four|COVID-19|SERI|Markov|Monte Carlo|China|R0|3.11|Beijing|2.78|Shanghai|2.02|Guangzhou|1.75|Shenzhen|Beijing|466|Feb 29, 2020|between 56%~159%|COVID-19|China|China","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-08","","10.1101/2020.03.06.20032177","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. Methods: We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. Findings: The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% CI: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% CI: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% CI: 19.47, 21.62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer. Interpretation: Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. Further study of the incubation distribution is warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods.","6d3b3f4ab80a61c45f82c61c6c756cfc6ddf4bf2","True","","2019|COVID-19|one|COVID-19|Wuhan|8.13 days|95%|CI|7.37-8.91|8.62 days|95%|CI|8.02|90th|14.65 days|95%|CI|14.00|99th|20.59 days|95%|CI|19.47|21.62|about 10%|COVID-19|14 days","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-10","","10.1101/2020.03.06.20032417","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Within a few weeks, the disease caused by SARA-CoV-2, which is named COVID-19, has escalated into an unprecedented ongoing outbreak with frightening speed, becoming a global health emergency. This study aimed to exam the prevalence and risk factors of acute posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in Chinese people shortly after the massive outbreak of COVID-19. Method An online anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted in mainland China between 30 January and 3 February, 2020. The survey consisted of two self-administered questionnaires: one was designed to require personal information (gender, age, education background), current location, recent exposure history of Wuhan, the classification of population, and subjective sleep quality; the other was the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), which was to assess PTSS referring to the outbreak. Results A total of 2091 Chinese participated in the current study. The prevalence of PTSS among the public in mainland China 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 4.6%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that gender (p < 0.001), exposure history of Wuhan (p = 0.047), classification of population (p < 0.001), and subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001) could be regarded as predictor factors for PTSS. Conclusions The results showed that some Chinese showed acute PTSS during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, comprehensive psychological intervention needs further implementation. Furthermore, females, people who having recent exposure history of Wuhan, those at high risk of infection or with poor sleep quality deserve special attention.","","False","","Wuhan|China|December 2019|a few weeks|SARA-CoV-2|COVID-19|Chinese|COVID-19|Method|China|between 30 January|3 February, 2020|two|one|Wuhan|the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5|PTSS|2091|Chinese|PTSS|China|1 month|COVID-19|4.6%|0.001|Wuhan|0.047|0.001|0.001|PTSS|Chinese|PTSS|COVID-19|Wuhan","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORG|PERSON|NORP|ORG|PERSON|GPE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|LAW|GPE|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|NORP|GPE|ORG|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-10","","10.1101/2020.03.06.20032425","biorxiv_medrxiv"

RT-qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection. RT-qPCR in-house protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 have been described. Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT-qPCR protocols for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized) and E presented appropriated analytical sensibility and specificity in our automated RT-qPCR workflow for COVID-19 virus, E being at least 4-fold less sensitive than the others. This study highlights the importance of local validation of in-house assays before its availability to the population.

Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. RESULTS We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Those findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of COVID-19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the SARS-CoV-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value.","","False","","239|7|Nucleic|20|10 minutes|100%|3 days|73.6%|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|TIME|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-10","","10.1101/2020.03.07.20032524",""

We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. Data on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS Seventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were included. A total of 3470 COVID-19 patients were synthesized to the final analysis in an unbiased manner. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001).

Design The study was an observational, descriptive study. Setting This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China. Participants 12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), α1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury. Results While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury. Conclusions Early renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19. Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.","","False","","COVID-19|COVID-19|tertiary|Guangdong|China|12|January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020|COVID-19|Ccr|UMA|A1M|IGU|TRU|COVID-19|Scr|BUN|Ccr|UACR|66.7%|41.7%|41.7%|AUC|COVID-19|0.875|UMA|0,813|A1M|0.813|IGU|0.750|TRU|0.750|neutrophil|NER|Hypokalemia|COVID-19|COVID-19|UMA|A1M|IGU|TRU|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-10","","10.1101/2020.03.07.20032599",""

We aimed to evaluate the definite efficacy and safety of corticosteroid in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Forty-six hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at Wuhan Union Hospital from January 20 to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received corticosteroid treatment. The clinical symptoms and chest computed tomography(CT) results were compared. Results: A total of 26 patients received intravenous administration of methylprednisolone with a dosage of 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days, while the remaining patients not. There was no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, clinical or laboratory parameters between the two groups on admission. The average number of days for body temperature back to the normal range was significantly shorter in patients with administration of methylprednisolone when compared to those without administration of methylprednisolone (2.06 ± 0.28 vs. 5.29 ± 0.70, P=0.010).

Because live SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully isolated from a stool sample from a COVID-19 patient in China, the results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients may remain infectious for long periods, and fecal-oral transmission may be possible. Therefore, our finding has important implications for infection control.","598d3eb737dfa7701ce8c29c86bc9f6589d8a581","True","","2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|the Hospital for Tropical Diseases|Ho Chi Minh City|Vietnam|RNA|RT-PCR|day 11|18|China|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.07.20032052","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Luca Ferretti; Chris Wymant; Michelle Kendall; Lele Zhao; Anel Nurtay; David G Bonsall; Christophe Fraser","Quantifying dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests that epidemic control and avoidance is feasible through instantaneous digital contact tracing","Mobile phone apps implementing algorithmic contact tracing can speed up the process of tracing newly diagnosed individuals, spreading information instantaneously back through a past contact network to inform them that they are at risk of being infected, and thus allow them to take appropriate social distancing and testing measures. The aim of non-pharmaceutical infection prevention is to move a population towards herd protection, a state where a population maintains R​0<​1, thus making it impossible for a pathogen to cause an epidemic. Here, we address epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. First we quantify the parameters of COVID-19 in a framework that is consistent with the renewal equation formulation of epidemic spread. Second, we use an analytical solution to application of first-degree contact tracing in the renewal equation model to explore combinations of efficacy that can induce herd protection (R​0<​1). With the emergence of the novel viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2, of clear potential for a global pandemic with high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems, the question of prevention has critical priority. We come to the conclusion that isolating symptomatic cases and tracing their contacts in a classical manner is not sufficiently fast to stop the spread of the epidemic and needs to be accompanied by measures of social distancing that are disruptive to a wide number of people. We show that first-degree instantaneous contact tracing, informing users when they can move safely or when to seek medical help and avoid vulnerable individuals, has the potential to stop the spread of the epidemic if used by a sufficiently large number of people with reasonable fidelity.","c91b581d38243c502118d93fc6f71ee02ec395e4","True","","First|COVID-19|Second|first|first","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-12","","10.1101/2020.03.08.20032946","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Valentina Costantino; David James Heslop; Chandini Raina MacIntyre","The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.","Australia implemented a travel ban on China on February 1st 2020. Partial lifting of the ban is being considered, given the decline in incidence of COVID-19 in China. We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control in Australia. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two was the current ban, scenario three was a partial lifting of the current ban to allow over 100,000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists. We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We estimated the true incidence of disease in China using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases. We used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. The modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date. The modelled impact without a travel ban implemented on February the 1st shows the epidemic would continue for more than a year resulting in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths. The impact of a partial lifting of a ban is minimal, and may be safe to consider. Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia and averted a much larger epidemic. The epidemic is still containable if other measures are used in tandem as cases surge in other countries. This research can inform decisions on placing or lifting travel bans as a control measure for the COVID-19 epidemic.","4f53e43ba1bfb84611eaa839994f9297cdd65dc9","True","","Australia|China|February 1st 2020|China|three|Australia|one|two|three|100,000|Australia|China|China|Australia|China|18|57|March 6th|Australia|66|February|more than a year|more than 2000|about 400|COVID-19|Australia|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-12","","10.1101/2020.03.09.20032045","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and virologic characteristics of the first 12 U.S. patients with COVID-19. Methods: We collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by CDC during January 20-February 5, 2020 to have COVID-19. Respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing. Results: Among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to China, and two were contacts of patients in this series. Commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). Seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. Three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. All patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rRT-PCR Ct values often detected in the first week. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool from 7/10 patients. Conclusions: In 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable virus were detected early, and prolonged RNA detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long. Hospitalized patients showed signs of worsening in the second week after illness onset.","67a2ae408efcb6686a22ae27435c7e4fa10c4a21","True","","More than 93,000|first|12|U.S.|12|CDC|January 20-February 5, 2020|12|53 years|21-68|8|10|China|two|n=7|Seven|the second week|Three|RNA|2-3 weeks|Ct|the first week|RNA|seven|RNA|7/10|12|RNA|RNA|Hospitalized|the second week","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|NORP|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-12","","10.1101/2020.03.09.20032896","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods In this single center, observational study, We recruited all Death Cases with COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020 in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.Demographics, basic diseases, X-ray/CT results, possible therapy strategies and test results when their entrance into admission, ICU and 48 h before death were collected and analyzed. Results This study involved 101 COVID-19 dead cases in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.47 patients went directly to the ICU because of critical condition, and 54 patients were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition.57 (56.44%) were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%) were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria.The cases included 64 males and 37 females with average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The blood type distribution was significantly different, with type A 44.44%, type B 29.29%, type AB 8.08% and type O 18.19%.The clinical manifestations of new coronavirus pneumonia are non-specific,the common symptom was fever (91 [90.10%] of 101 patients),Cough (69[68.32%]) and dyspnea (75[74.26%]). Neutrophils, PCT, CRP,IL-6,D-dimer gradually increased as time went on.Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission,with the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased.61(60.40%) used antiviral drugs,59(58.42%) used glucocorticoids, 63.37% used intravenous immunoglobulins, and 44.55% used thymosin preparations. All patients received antibiotic treatment, 63(62.38%) used restricted antibiotics, 23(22.78%) used antifungal drugs.84(83.17%) used non-invasive ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy equipment, and 76.24% used invasive mechanical ventilation. 7 patients were treated with ECMO and 8 patients were treated with CRRT.The median time from ARDS to invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.00 days(IQR 0.00-6.00). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 5 days (IQR2.00-8.00). Conclusions Critical COVID-19 can cause fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure with high mortality rate. Heart may be the earliest damaged organ except the lungs.

As of 20 Feb 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff. Methods In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (<= 10 days) and group 2 (>10 days). Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge. Findings The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% were female and 67% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesale market or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (5%) as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%). Fever (67%) was the most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The median time interval between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 days. On admission, 80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 34% had lymphocytopenia. Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (61%), subpleural (80%) and ground-glass (52%) opacities. During the study period, no patients was transferred to intensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass index (BMI) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for discharge. Interpretation In this study, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course, which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. Smaller BMI, absence of fever symptoms and normal IL-6 levels on admission are favorable for discharge for medical staff. Further studies should be devoted to identifying the exact patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection among medical staff.","9ae476404f7ef1ec1ede965f0b898f31a5bf5a81","True","","December 2019|Wuhan city|China|20 Feb 2020|2,055|2019|COVID-19|China|64|Union Hospital|Wuhan|between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020|Two|1|10 days|2|10 days|Kaplan-Meier|Cox|35 years old|64%|67%|Huanan|5%|8%|5%|67%|47%|34%|8.5 days|80%|IL-6|34%|Chest|61%|80%|52%|34|53%|BMI|95%|CI|0.03-0.73|0.24|95%|CI|0.09-0.60|IL-6|0.31|95%|CI 0.11-0.87|COVID-19|BMI|IL-6","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|PERSON|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|NORP|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.09.20033118","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We aimed to investigate the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of these patients. We included 67 Tibetan patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of clinical symptoms at admission, with 31 and 36 patients in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, respectively. The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics were extracted and analysed. No patient had a history of exposure to COVID-19 patients from Wuhan or had travelled to Wuhan.

Capacity needs in Chinese cities could inform the planning of local healthcare resources. Methods: We described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs. Results: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within one week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for an average of 9 ICU patients and 20 inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition, and 38 were classified as serious. If a Wuhan-like outbreak were to happen in a US city, the need for healthcare resources may be higher in cities with a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations. Conclusion: Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local healthcare system in US cities.","8bb82a543720a74015bce24945dc0955b666ae7d","True","","US|Chinese|ICU|COVID-19|two|Chinese|Wuhan|Guangzhou|January 10 to February 29, 2020|ICU|US|Wuhan|Wuhan|six weeks|Between January 10 and February 29|637|ICU|3,454|each day|19,425|24.5|10,000|9,689|12.2|10,000|2,087|2.6|10,000|Guangzhou|one week|Between January 24 and February 29|COVID-19|9|20|each day|15|38|Wuhan|US|Wuhan|January 23|ICU|at least a month|COVID-19|US","medrvix","","","","GPE|NORP|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.09.20033241","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: We used individual-case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location-based under ascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. Findings: We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9,19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1,24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56%,3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%,1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages.

Healthcare authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders. A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p<0.05. Results: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (30.2%) and medical students (29.6%). Regarding COVID-19, most of the participants used social media to obtain information (61%), and a significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (61%) and symptom onset (63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19 prevention and control. Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and poor perception of COVID-19. Conclusion: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs beyond borders, and further studies are warranted.","f734d47a423cbe54ec0cc9b2dee39470cf74fd9b","True","","the first week of March|2019|COVID-19|over 100|more than 100,000|Healthcare|COVID-19|the first week of March 2020|23-item|5 minutes|529|453|85.6%|51.6%|32.1%|25-34 years|30.2%|29.6%|61%|61%|63.6%|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|TIME|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.09.20033381","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Jude Bayham; Eli P Fenichel","The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects","Background COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. Conclusion School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. The results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality.","14220553c9160c06bb99f59d59e6a8ecf3595226","True","","the United States|US|US|US|the United States|29%|3-12|13 years old|15%|7%|35%|31%|only 24%|over 10|15%|15%|2%|15%|17.6%|2%|2.35%|15%|COVID-19|25%","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.09.20033415","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. The experience of outbreak control in mainland China should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world including South Korea.","ac3e33b6ed12e43208d76bf455f3b81067e6ac6d","True","","COVID-19|three|China|Guangdong|China|South Korea|two|South Korea|Guangdong|China|2.6|95%|CI|2.5|2.7|3.0|95%CI|2.6|3.3|3.8|95%CI|3.5,4.2|5 days|3 days|Guangdong|China|1|February 8th and 18th|South Korea|South Korea|China|China|COVID-19|South Korea|China|South Korea","medrvix","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.09.20033464","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We estimated model parameters from published information with the statistical method and stochastic simulation, we found the parameters that achieved the best simulation test result. The next stage involved quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the QSEIR model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland China. The main results are as follows. If the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020. During March18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. The end date would be in the period from August 20 to September 1, 2020. With 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies. The sensitive analysis indicated that the quarantine measures (or with vaccination) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic, followed by measures to increase the cured rate (like finding special medicine). The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world. In mainland China, the quarantine measures can't be relaxed before the end of March 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriate anti-epidemic measures beginning in early April 2020. The results of this study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences.","f4fecacaff35a0498dee4231408c6b9aa049c51b","True","","QSEIR|China|QSEIR|China|[52438, 64090|February 7 to February 19, 2020|March18-30|August 20 to September 1, 2020|80%|4 days ahead|0.43%|China|QSEIR|QSEIR|China|before the end of March 2020|China|early April 2020","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|DATE|DATE|PERSON|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.09.20033498","biorxiv_medrxiv"

We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R_0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R_0 will be under-estimated. We also show that as the length of asymptomatic generation intervals increase, estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase of the epidemic decrease. Our analysis provides a rationale for assessing the duration of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in addition to their prevalence in the population.","f628a6163a739a85fd972c00b7d274823c41bb66","True","","R_0|R_0|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.09.20033514","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) due to novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related infection (COVID-19) is characterized by severe ventilation perfusion mismatch leading to refractory hypoxemia. To date, there is no specific treatment available for 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator gas used as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In has also shown in-vitro and clinical evidence that inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) has antiviral activity against other strains of coronavirus. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether inhaled NO improves oxygenation in patients with hypoxic SARS-CoV2. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation. Patients will be blinded to the treatment. Methods and analysis. Intubated patients admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe hypoxemia will be randomized to receive inhalation of NO (treatment group) or not (control group). Treatment will be stopped when patients are free from hypoxemia for more than 24 hours. The primary outcome evaluates levels of oxygenation between the two groups at 48 hours. Secondary outcomes include rate of survival rate at 28 and 90 days in the two groups, time to resolution of severe hypoxemia, time to achieve negativity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. Ethics and dissemination. The study protocol has been approved by the Investigational Review Board of Xijing Hospital (Xian, China) and pending the Partners Human Research Committee (Boston, USA). Recruitment will start after approval of both IRBs and local IRBs at other enrolling centers.

However, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of them are still unknown. Methods: We collected data of 46 confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 10 to 35 years from the study hospital. The demographics, epidemiological, and clinical data were collected. Several key epidemiological parameters, the asymptomatic cases and transmission to their family members and the clinical characteristics at admission, and during treatment were summarized. RESULTS: Of 46 confirmed patients, 14 patients (47.3%) were aged from 10 to 24 years, and 24 (52.7%) patients were male. The mean incubation period for symptomatic cases was 6.6 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4 - 9.6). The median serial interval was 1.9 days (95% CI 0.4 - 6.2). Three of asymptomatic cases showed the transmission to their family members. Only 1 patient was identified as severe cases at admission. The common symptoms at admission were dry cough (34, 91.0%), and fever (29, 69.0%). Nearly 60% of the patients had showed ground-glass opacity by chest CT findings. Three patients developed acute kidney injury during treatment. Majority of patients (78.3%) were discharged by the end of the follow-up. Conclusions: The adolescent and young adult patients of COVID-19 had a long incubation period, and a short serial interval. The transmission to their family contactors occurred in asymptomatic cases.

In a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over China, greatly threatening public health and economic development. The Chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these Chinese strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Methods: From the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial Health Commission websites of China, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. We further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (Speedmax). Comparing different times to Speedmax of different areas in China, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. Also, The number of plateaus were analyzed. Results: The quartic model showed the best fit. For almost all areas in mainland China, the speed of infections reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei. The number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. However, the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China. Conclusion: Our study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. These strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the COVID-19 epidemic.","9e4b67ef6613c31882bb561d28770203da19771b","True","","December 2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei Province|China|China|Chinese|Chinese|COVID-19|Health Commission|China|China|China|Speedmax|14 days|Hebei|Heilongjiang|Hainan|Guizhou|Hubei|Hubei|Speedmax|COVID-19|China|Chinese|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|NORP|NORP|PERSON|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|NORP|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-12","","10.1101/2020.03.10.20032755","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"tianyi qiu; Han Xiao","Revealing the influence of national public health policies for the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Wuhan, China through status dynamic modeling","Background The epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now is spreading worldwide. The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan. Methods A real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020. Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. Finding According to our study, the first patient is most likely appeared on Nov. 29th, 2019. There had already been 4,153 infected people and 6,536 exposed ones with the basic reproduction number R_0 of 2.65 before lockdown, whereas R_0 dropped to 1.98 for the first 30 days after the lockdown. The peak point is Feb. 17th, 2020 with 24,115 infected people and the end point is Jun. 17th, 2020. In total, 77,453 people will be infected. If lockdown imposed 7 days earlier, the total number of infected people would be 21,508, while delaying the lockdown by 1-6 days would expand the infection scale 1.23 to 4.94 times. A delay for 7 days would make the epidemic finally out of control. Doubling the number of beds in hospitals would decrease the total infections by 28%, and further investment in bed numbers would yield a diminishing return. Last, public gathering events that increased the transmission parameter by 5% in one single day would increase 4,243 infected people eventually. Interpretation Our model forecasted that the peak time in Wuhan was Feb. 17th, 2020 and the epidemic in Wuhan is now under control. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is currently a global public health threat for all nations. Multiple countries including South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, and the United States are suffering from SARS-CoV-2. Our study, which simulated the epidemic in Wuhan, the first city in the world fighting against SARS-CoV-2, may provide useful guidance for other countries in dealing with similar situations.","5aa0306fa361d31085f6df03d7e71307534b34c6","True","","first|Wuhan|China|Chinese|Wuhan|Wuhan|Wuhan|Susceptible (S|Exposed|Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020|first|Nov. 29th, 2019|4,153|6,536|R_0|2.65|R_0|1.98|the first 30 days|Feb. 17th, 2020|24,115|Jun. 17th, 2020|77,453|7 days earlier|21,508|1-6 days|1.23|4.94|7 days|28%|5%|one single day|4,243|Wuhan|Feb. 17th, 2020|Wuhan|South Korea|Japan|Iran|Italy|the United States|Wuhan|first","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|NORP|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-12","","10.1101/2020.03.10.20032995","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease. Methods and analysis: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study.

There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. Results During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. There were three (18.8%) and two (10.5%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during hospital stay. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal complications. Conclusion Severe maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal delivery or caesarean section. Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.","e08d308e5923cb4f741d34a6cd3548a17a04a2b1","True","","2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|January 24 to February 29, 2020|sixteen|COVID-19|eighteen|third|Two|CT|COVID-19|COVID-19|ALT|three|18.8%|two|10.5%|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.10.20033605","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: The clinical data of 33 patients with respiratory symptoms caused by the novel coronavirus in Wenzhou city from January 15 to February 12,2020,were thoroughly reviewed. At the onset of the disease,we found that the primary symptoms were fever,cough,fatigue,chest tightness,chest pain and specific blood test results. According to the patients'histories,the patients were divided into two groups: those who spent time in the main epidemic area and those who did not spend time in the main epidemic area. The differences in the clinical manifestations between these two groups were analyzed. Results: The main clinical symptoms of patients infected with novel coronavirus in the secondary epidemic area were respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms. After grouping patients based on the presence or absence of residency in or travel history to the main epidemic area, there was no significant difference between the baseline data of these two groups, and there were no significant differences in symptoms and signs between the two groups (P>0.05). Some patients had abnormally increased serum amyloid protein A (SAA). There were statistically significant differences in the leukocyte count/C-reactive protein,monocyte ratio/C-reactive protein,neutrophil count/C-reactive protein,monocyte count/C-reactive protein and hemoglobin/C-reactive protein values between the two groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms were the primary symptoms of novel coronavirus infection in the secondary epidemic area; these symptoms are not typical. The abnormal increase in serum amyloid protein (SAA) may be used as an auxiliary index for diagnosis and treatment. CRP changes before other blood parameters and thus may be an effective evaluation index for patients with COVID-19 infection.","92413565e9d507fdf5550d5123ef420948ae993c","True","","33|Wenzhou|January 15 to February|two|two|two|two|P>0.05|SAA|neutrophil|two|0.05|SAA","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.10.20033613","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Zhong Zheng; Ke Wu; Zhixian Yao; Junhua Zheng; Jian Chen","The Prediction for Development of COVID-19 in Global Major Epidemic Areas Through Empirical Trends in China by Utilizing State Transition Matrix Model","Background: Since pneumonia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, tremendous infected cases has risen all over the world attributed to high transmissibility. We managed to mathematically forecast the inflection point (IFP) of new cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, utilizing the transcendental model from Hubei and non-Hubei in China. Methods: We extracted data from reports released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the IFP of new cases in Hubei and non-Hubei on subsequent days and the data from Mar 6 to Mar 9 as validation set. New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, the horizon of the IFP of time (the rate of new increment reaches zero) could be predicted in South Korean, Italy, and Iran. Also, through this model, the global trend of the epidemic will be decoded to allocate international medical resources better and instruct the strategy for quarantine. Results: the optimistic scenario (non-Hubei model, daily increment rate of -3.87%), the relative pessimistic scenario (Hubei model, daily increment rate of -2.20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of -1.50%) were inferred and modeling from data in China. Matching and fitting with these scenarios, the IFP of time in South Korea would be Mar 6-Mar 12, Italy Mar 10-Mar 24, and Iran is Mar 10-Mar 24. The numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20k in South Korea, 209k in Italy, and 226k in Iran under fitting scenarios, respectively. There should be room for improvement if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the IFP will arrive earlier than our estimation. However, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model. If that happens, the IFP of increment will be higher than predicted above. Conclusion: We can affirm that the end of the burst of the epidemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating. With the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative to consummate the assignment of global medical resources to manipulate the development of COVID-19.","c2a84d150958eb9c206a388660a12e4f5fa6fa1c","True","","2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|Hubei|China|IFP|South Korea|Italy|Iran|Hubei|non-Hubei|China|the National Health Commission|the People's Republic of China|Dec 31, 2019 to|Mar 5, 2020|World Health Organization|Jan 20, 2020|Mar 5, 2020|IFP|Hubei|non-Hubei|days|IFP|zero|South Korean|Italy|Iran|-3.87%|Hubei|-2.20%|daily|-1.50%|China|IFP|South Korea|Mar 6-Mar 12|Italy|Mar 10-Mar 24|Iran|Mar 10-Mar 24|approximately 20k|South Korea|209k|Italy|226k|Iran|IFP|IFP|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|GPE|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|GPE|PERSON|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|DATE|GPE|FAC|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.10.20033670","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods: We evaluated whether and under which conditions it is possible to control and slow down a COVID-19 epidemic in the early stages by isolation and contact tracing. We used a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to a person becoming infectious), and overall transmissibility. The model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. Findings: The analyses showed that transmissibility and the duration of the latent period relative to the duration of incubation period have strong impact on the controllability of the disease. Delays in diagnosis of cases and proportion of asymptomatic cases are key factors for containment and slowing down the epidemic. Interpretation: Isolation and contact tracing can be an effective means to control early epidemics, but only if transmissibility as measured by R0 is in the lower ranges of reported values. Timeliness as well as completeness of tracing and diagnosis of cases are paramount to achieve containment and effective slowing down of the epidemic growth rate.","ee7f56d556c2063d71905df34a589bbf5f1ff051","True","","COVID-19|R0","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.10.20033738","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: An observational case-control study of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, conducted in Feb 2020. Final date of follow-up: Feb 29, 2020. Cases were grouped according to COVID-19 pneumonia severity (mild/moderate, severe/critical), and MTB infection status compared. Comparisons were made with MTB infection data from another case-control study on bacterial/viral pneumonia at Shenyang Chest Hospital. Setting: Multi-center study involving three primary care hospitals in Shenyang, China. Participants: 86 suspected COVID-19 cases from participating primary-care hospitals in Shenyang. All 36 SARS-CoV-2 +ve cases (based on RT-PCR assay) were included. Disease severity was assessed using the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China (v6). Mean age, 47 years (range: 25-79), gender ratio, 1:1. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Interferon-gamma Release Assays (IGRA) were performed using peripheral blood to determine MTB infection. Main Outcome and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were collected. Comparison of MTB infection status between patients with mild/moderate and severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: Mean age of 36 COVID-19 patients: 47 (range: 25-79); M/F: 18/18; Wuhan/Hubei connection: 42%. Mild/moderate cases: 27 (75%); severe/critical: 9 (25%). MTB infection (IGRA+ve): 13 cases (36.11%), including 7 of 9 severe/critical cases. MTB infection rate: higher in COVID-19 (36.11%) than bacterial pneumonia (20%; p=0.0047) and viral pneumonia patients (16.13%; p=0.024). MTB infection more common than other co-morbidities (36.11% vs diabetes: 25%; hypertension: 22.2%; coronary heart disease: 8.33%; COPD: 5.56%). MTB co-infection linked with disease severity (severe/critical 78% vs mild/moderate cases 22%; p=0.0049), and rate of disease progression: infection to development of symptoms (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 6.5+/-4.2 days vs SARS-COV-2: 8.9+/-5.2 days; p=0.073); from symptom development to diagnosed as severe (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 3.4+/-2.0 days vs SARS-COV-2: 7.5+/-0.5 days; p=0.075). Conclusions and Relevance: MTB infection likely increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, and increases COVID-19 severity, but this requires validation in a larger study. MTB infection status of COVID-19 patients should be checked routinely at hospital admission.","33a6aa86bb6fe30251d7f2c1f64c5b7a94c391a0","True","","COVID-19|Wuhan|China|Dec 2019|MTB|COVID-19|TB|COVID-19|36|Shenyang|China|Feb 2020|Feb 29, 2020|COVID-19|MTB|MTB|Shenyang Chest Hospital|three|Shenyang|China|86|Shenyang|36|RT-PCR|the National Health Commission of China|47 years|25-79|1:1|MTB|COVID-19|36|COVID-19|47|25-79|18/18|Wuhan/Hubei|42%|27|75%|9|25%|IGRA+ve|13|36.11%|7|9|COVID-19|36.11%|20%|p=0.0047|16.13%|36.11%|25%|22.2%|8.33%|COPD|5.56%|78%|22%|6.5+/-4.2|days|8.9+/-5.2 days|3.4+/-2.0 days|7.5+/-0.5 days|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.10.20033795","biorxiv_medrxiv"

A good understanding of the dynamic of the disease would greatly enhance the control and prevention of COVID-19. However, to the best of our knowledge, the unique features of the outbreak have limited the applications of all existing models. In this paper, a novel stochastic model is proposed which aims to account for the unique transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and capture the effects of intervention measures implemented in Mainland China. We find that, (1) instead of aberration, there is a remarkable amount of asymptomatic individuals, (2) an individual with symptoms is approximately twice more likely to pass the disease to others than that of an asymptomatic patient, (3) the transmission rate has reduced significantly since the implementation of control measures in Mainland China, (4) it is expected that the epidemic outbreak would be contained by early March in the the selected provinces and cities.","fd6163a04c4ac0100a7c9be19def78d2171eac47","True","","2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|Mainland China|3|Mainland China|4|early March","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|LOC|CARDINAL|LOC|CARDINAL|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.10.20033803","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Yuke Wang; Peter F.M. Teunis","Strongly heterogeneous transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China: local and regional variation","Background The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in the city of Wuhan, China, with a period of rapid initial spread. Transmission on a regional and then national scale was promoted by intense travel during the holiday period of the Chinese New Year. We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China. Methods In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase of the outbreak the region of Wuhan city acted as a hot spot, generating new cases upon contact, while locally, in other provinces, transmission was low. Interpretation COVID-19 is capable of spreading very rapidly. The sizes of outbreak in provinces of mainland China mainly depended on the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan as the local reproduction numbers were low. The COVID-19 epidemic should be controllable with appropriate interventions.

To investigate the underlining mechanism, we isolated one strain of SARS- CoV-2 (ZJ01) in mild COVID-19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by gene alignment. Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 were both T at these two sites, becoming the only TT type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and the electrostatic distribution of the S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19 subtypes.","f2f114ba9f0b618a8b2396ab87f2d861ba9fd483","True","","788|COVID-19|Wuhan|one|SARS-|ZJ01|COVID-19|35|ZJ01|54|8824|28247|two|TT|Furin|FCS|FCS|FCS|F1-2|Furin|ACE2-Furin|Furin|FCS|FCS|FCS|PRRA|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|LAW|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|FAC|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.10.20033944","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Methods and results Data were collected from patients medical records, and we defined cardiac injury according to cardiac biomarker troponin I level > 0.03>ug/L. Among the 291 patients, 15 (5.2%) showed evidence of cardiac injury. Of 16 hospitalized patients with cardiac injury, the median age was 62 years, and 11/15 (73.3%) were men. Underlying cardiovascular diseases in some patients were hypertension (n=7, 46.6%), coronary heart disease (n=3, 20%) and diabetes (n=3, 20%). The most common symptoms at illness onset in patients with cardiac injury were fever (n=11, 73.3%), cough (n=7, 46.7%), headache or fatigue (n=5, 33.3%) and dyspnoea (n=4, 26.6%). These patients had higher systolic pressures, and lower lymphocyte counts and platelet counts, compared with patients without cardiac injury, respectively. Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and elevated C-reactive protein occurred in all patients with cardiac injury. Compared with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (73.3%), and receive mechanical ventilation (53.4%), continuous renal replacement therapy (33.3%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (26.7%) and vasopressor therapy (26.7%) and be admitted to the intensive care unit (73.3%).

DESIGN The study was conducted by comparing the blood group distribution in 2,173 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 test from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China with that in normal people from the corresponding regions. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and 2-tailed χ2 and a meta-analysis was performed by random effects models. SETTING Three tertiary hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1,775 patients with COVID-19, including 206 dead cases, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China were recruited. Another 113 and 285 patients with COVID-19 were respectively recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan and Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Detection of ABO blood groups, infection occurrence of SARS-CoV-2, and patient death RESULTS The ABO group in 3694 normal people in Wuhan showed a distribution of 32.16%, 24.90%, 9.10% and 33.84% for A, B, AB and O, respectively, versus the distribution of 37.75%, 26.42%, 10.03% and 25.80% for A, B, AB and O, respectively, in 1775 COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. The proportion of blood group A and O in COVID-19 patients were significantly higher and lower, respectively, than that in normal people (both P < 0.001).

Meta-analyses on the pooled data showed that blood group A had a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 (odds ratio-OR, 1.20; 95% confidence interval-CI 1.02~1.43, P = 0.02) compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease (OR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.60~0.75, P < 0.001) compared with non-O blood groups.In addition, the influence of age and gender on the ABO blood group distribution in patients with COVID-19 from two Wuhan hospitals (1,888 patients) were analyzed and found that age and gender do not have much effect on the distribution. CONCLUSION People with blood group A have a significantly higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O has a significantly lower risk for the infection compared with non-O blood groups.","bb6317ba4c887c1e5d5409d3727c908234f307ea","True","","ABO|COVID-19|2,173|COVID-19|three|Wuhan|Shenzhen|China|one|ANOVA|2-tailed|χ2|Three|tertiary|Wuhan|Shenzhen|China|1,775|COVID-19|206|Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital|Wuhan|China|113|285|COVID-19|Renmin Hospital|Wuhan University|Wuhan|Shenzhen|People's Hospital|Shenzhen|China|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Detection|ABO|3694|Wuhan|32.16%|24.90%|9.10%|33.84%|AB|37.75%|26.42%|10.03%|25.80%|AB|1775|COVID-19|Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital|COVID-19|0.001|398|two|Wuhan|Shenzhen|COVID-19|1.20|95%|CI|0.02|0.67|95%|CI|0.001|ABO|COVID-19|two|Wuhan|1,888|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|LAW|ORG|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.11.20031096","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most published studies focus on adult populations, whereas data concerning pediatric patients is relatively scarce. Methods: From January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was transmitted from the children to others. Severity of disease of these children was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent and predominant symptom at onset of illness (two cases had body temperature higher than 38.5 Celsius). All children showed increased lymphocytes (>4.4*109/L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. One child had elevated serum levels of procalcitonin and C-reaction protein. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas persistent presence of viral RNA was found in stools of all children. One case had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 8 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 20 days. At the time of writing, one child still had positive results for RT-PCR analysis in stools after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory samples (over 19 days behind). Conclusions: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are very different from adult patients in regards to epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.","f14434d7d3b68f4fe7f68adba747b7700ccdd6ac","True","","2|2019|COVID-19|January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020|three|COVID-19|Qingdao|Shandong Province|China|RT-PCR|RNA|three|two|38.5|4.4|One|COVID-19|two weeks|RNA|One|negative 8 days|20 days|RT-PCR|RNA|19 days|Pediatric|COVID-19|Prolonged","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|DATE|NORP|PERSON|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.11.20033159","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The case fatality rate is the most direct indicator to assess the hazards of an infectious disease. We aimed to estimate the instant fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province. Methods We collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 from Dec 8, 2019 to Mar 10, 2020 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province officially announced by the Chinese authority. The numbers of daily confirmed/deaths/cured cases and the numbers of daily cumulative confirmed/deaths/cured cases were obtained. The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were calculated based on the dates of diagnosis, death and discharge of individual cases. Then the estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were obtained on the basis of the median death or medium cure time, respectively. Finally, the instant fatality rate of COVID-19 was calculated according to the numbers of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates. Results From Jan 1, 2020 to Feb 22, 2020 in Wuhan City, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.4%～19.5% and the instant cured rate was 80.0%～96.6%. The average fatality rate reached 11.4% while the average cure rate was 88.6%. During the same period in Hubei Province, the instant case fatality rate was 3.8%～16.6% and the instant cured rate was 83.4%～96.6%. The average fatality rate and the average cure rate were 9.2% and 91.8%, respectively. Conclusions The fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province were underestimated. Wuhan showed higher fatality rate and cure rate than the whole Hubei Province did.","982689f92bf67e90a43fc142c605da9a5045f756","True","","2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|COVID-19|Wuhan City|Hubei Province|daily|COVID-19|Dec 8, 2019 to|Mar 10, 2020|Wuhan City|Hubei Province|Chinese|daily|daily|COVID-19|COVID-19|Jan 1, 2020 to Feb 22, 2020|Wuhan City|COVID-19|3.4%～19.5%|80.0%～96.6%|11.4%|88.6%|the same period|Hubei Province|3.8%～16.6%|83.4%～96.6%|9.2%|91.8%|COVID-19|Wuhan City|Hubei Province|Wuhan|Hubei Province","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|NORP|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|GPE|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-13","","10.1101/2020.03.11.20034215","biorxiv_medrxiv"

"Ke Wu; Didier Darcet; Qian Wang; Didier Sornette","Generalized logistic growth modeling of the COVID-19 outbreak in 29 provinces in China and in the rest of the world","Background: the COVID-19 has been successfully contained in China but is spreading all over the world. We use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We use the experience from China to analyze the calibration results on Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Europe, and make future scenario projections. Methods: we calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized Richards model to the reported number of infected cases from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China, 29 provinces in China, four severely affected countries and Europe as a whole. The different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions. Results: We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. Based on Chinese experience, we identify a high risk in Japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of March 25 being 1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340]) by June. For South Korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% CI: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. We estimate 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of Italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. We would expect 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% European population. Conclusions: The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. For other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. Japan and Italy are in serious situations with no short-term end to the outbreak to be expected. There is a significant risk concerning the upcoming July 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Iran's situation is highly uncertain with unclear and negative future scenarios, while South Korea is approaching the end of the outbreak. Both Europe and the USA are at early stages of the outbreak, posing significant health and economic risks to the world in absence of serious measures.","3298d34e643c7a157f4226fde679f71194e417b5","True","","COVID-19|China|China|China|Japan|South Korea|Iran|Italy|Europe|Richards|Jan. 19 to March 10|China|29|China|four|Europe|four|China|Chinese|Japan|March 25 being 1574|95%|CI|880|2372|5669|95%|CI|988|June|South Korea|7928|95%|CI|6341, 9754|20 days|0.15%|95%|CI|0.03%|0.30%|Italian|114867|Europe|10 days|0.015%|European|China|the coming months|Japan|Italy|July 2020|Olympics|Tokyo|Iran|South Korea|Europe|the USA","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|LOC|ORG|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|LOC|CARDINAL|GPE|NORP|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|FAC|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|GPE|DATE|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|NORP|DATE|LOC|DATE|PERCENT|NORP|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|EVENT|GPE|GPE|GPE|LOC|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.11.20034363","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Willem G Odendaal","A Method to Model Outbreaks of New Infectious Diseases with Pandemic Potential such as COVID-19","The emergence of the novel coronavirus (a.k.a. COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) out of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China caught the world by surprise. As the outbreak began to spread outside of China, too little was known about the virus to model its transmission with any acceptable accuracy. World governments responded to rampant minformation about the virus leading to collatoral disasters, such as plunging financial markets, that could have been avoided if better models of the outbreak had been available. This is an engineering approach to model the spread of a new infectious disease from sparse data when little is known about the infectious agent itself. The most sought after estimate is the projected number of people who may be contagious, but still be within the incubation period thus remaining asymptomatic and undetected. This parameter is useful for estimating the extent of outbreak among a population over time and what to expect. It is thus important for common sense decision making by governments, organizations, and even individuals to contain, prepare, prevent, react, and safeguard. A Monte Carlo approach is implemented by using incubation period and a variable, called testing efficiency as variables. The Coronavirus outbreak in USA will be used to illustrate the implementation of this modeling approach. Among others it is demonstrated that imposing early travel restrictions from infected countries slowed down the outbreak in the USA by about 26 days.","","False","","Wuhan|Hubei Province|China|China|Monte Carlo|Coronavirus|USA|USA|about 26 days","medrvix","","","","GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|GPE|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.11.20034512","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. Objective To investigate the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 contaminates healthcare settings, including to identify function zones of the hospital with the highest contamination levels and to identify the most contaminated objects, and personal protection equipment (PPE) in Wuhan, China. Design A field investigation was conducted to collect the surface swabs in various environments in the hospital and a laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Setting Six hundred twenty-six surface samples were collected within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan, China in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020. Participants Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major personal protection equipment (PPE). The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 RNAs Results The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%). We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. The most contaminated objects are self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were most contaminated PPE. Conclusions and Relevance Many surfaces were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 across the hospital in various patient care areas, commonly used objects, medical equipment, and PPE. The 13 hospital function zones were classified into four contamination levels. These findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention precautions among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19. The findings may have important implications for modifying and developing urgently needed policy to better protect healthcare workers during this ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.","254c1e4d661d7fb5954c855387595c3cde0e8156","True","","COVID-19|Wuhan|China|Wuhan|PPE|Wuhan|China|RNA|Six hundred twenty-six|the Zhongnan Medical Center|Wuhan|China|COVID-19|between February 7 - February 27, 2020|Dacron|13|five|three|PPE|RT-PCR|Main Outcomes|NCP|31.9%|Obstetric Isolation Ward|NCP|28.1%|Isolation Ward|NCP|19.6%|13|four|20.0%|16.8%|16.0%|20.3%|15.4%|PPE|PPE|13|four|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|FAC|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.11.20034546","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56 ℃ prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was pre-inactivated by heating.","2ae710bf5f60c23c489e4c61245a35a4f85178cb","True","","2|disease-2019|COVID-19|56|℃|56|℃|30 minutes|IgM|34|100%|COVID-19|53.56%|IgG|22|34|64.71%|49.54%|n=9|44.12%|IgM|56|℃|30 minutes","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|TIME|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|TIME","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.12.20034231","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Wuyue Yang; Dongyan Zhang; Liangrong Peng; Changjing Zhuge; Liu Hong","Rational evaluation of various epidemic models based on the COVID-19 data of China","During the study of epidemics, one of the most significant and also challenging problems is to forecast the future trends, on which all follow-up actions of individuals and governments heavily rely. However, to pick out a reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of COVID-19 epidemics which is spreading worldwide right now. In this paper, based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models widely used in the literature. We highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root mean square errors and robustness index to quantify these three golden means and to evaluate various epidemic models/methods. Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in the choice of the size of dataset in forecasting. Before the inflection point, no model considered here could make a reliable prediction. We further notice the Logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the dynamical models based on ODEs, it is observed that the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models generally show a better performance than SIR, SEIR and SEIR-AHQ models on the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine, and a proper trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy.","5470929d340ca0fbb030ce8e00a885a0d730adbe","True","","COVID-19|seven|China|the spring of 2020|eight|four|five|Akaike|three|Logistic|Gomertz|Bayesian|the SEIR-QD|SIR|SEIR|SEIR|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|NORP|PERSON|NORP|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.12.20034595","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Leung","Impact assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 and influenza in Hong Kong: an observational study","Background: A range of public health measures have been implemented to delay and reduce local transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and there have been major changes in behaviours of the general public. We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioral changes on the incidence of COVID-19 as well as on influenza virus infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed policy interventions and measured changes in population behaviours through two telephone surveys, on January 20-23 and February 11-14. We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R_t), for COVID-19 and influenza A(H1N1). Findings: COVID-19 transmissibility has remained at or below 1, indicating successful containment to date. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% confidence interval, CI: 34% to 53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, and a 33% (95% CI: 24% to 43%) reduction in transmissibility based on paediatric hospitalization rates. In the two surveys we estimated that 74.5% and 97.5% of the general adult population wore masks when going out, and 61.3% and 90.2% avoided going to crowded places, respectively. Implications: Containment measures, social distancing measures and changes in population behaviour have successfully prevented spread of COVID-19. The social distancing measures and behavioural changes led to a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early February 2020. However, it may be challenging to avoid fatigue and sustain these measures and population behaviours as COVID-19 continues to spread globally.

Previous study has reported several COVID-19 cases with conjunctivitis. However, the complete profiling of COVID-19 related ocular symptoms and diseases are still missing. We aim to investigate the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of five hundred and thirty-four patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, systemic concomitant symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, radiologic findings, and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR from questionnaires and electronic medical records. Results: The median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital, respectively. Of 534 COVID-19 patients, 25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 4.9 ± 2.6 days (mean [SD]), ranging from 2 to 10 days. Dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three COVID-19 related ocular symptoms. Notably, a total of 332 COVID-19 patients (62%) had a hand-eye contact history. We also found that some COVID-19 patients had a history of eye disease, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.18%), dry eye (24, 4.49%), keratitis (14, 2.62%), cataract (9, 1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (5, 0.94%). In consistent with previous studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue. Patients, 60.5% in Mobile Cabin Hospital and 67.5% in Tongji Hospital, respectively were confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection. Conclusions: Conjunctival congestion was one of the COVID-19 related ocular symptoms, which may have clinical diagnostic significance. It is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection, as dirty hand-eye contact might be a high risk factor of COVID-19. Further detailed and comprehensive ophthalmological guidance is needed for COVID-19 control.","622580ea34c3acc011faa7573bc549e34078edde","True","","first|Wuhan|China|December 2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|five hundred and thirty-four|Mobile Cabin Hospital|Tongji Hospital|RT-PCR|40 and 50 years|Mobile Cabin Hospital|Tongji Hospital|534|25|4.68%|3|4.9 ± 2.6|2 to 10 days|Dry|112|20.97%|68|12.73%|63|11.80%|three|COVID-19|332|62%|COVID-19|33|6.18%|24|4.49%|14|2.62%|9, 1.69%|5|0.94%|60.5%|Mobile Cabin Hospital|67.5%|Tongji Hospital|one|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|MONEY|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.12.20034678","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients have been revealed recently. However, the information of paediatric patients remains unclear. We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of paediatric patients to provide valuable insight into early diagnosis of COVID-19 in children, as well as epidemic control policy making. METHODS and FINDINGS This retrospective, observational study was a case series performed at 4 hospitals in the west of China. Thirty-four paediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 1 to February 25, 2020. And the final follow-up visit was completed by February 28, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed on 34 paediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, IQR 10.00 - 94.25), among whom 14 males (41.18%) were included. 47.60% of patients were noticed without any exposure history. The median incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 - 25.25) days. Infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47.06%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76.47%), cough (58.82%), and expectoration (20.59%). Vomiting (11.76%) and diarrhea (11.76%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A remarkable increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (85.00%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (58.62%), while a decrease of prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (78.13%). In addition, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase was increased significantly in 28 patients (82.35%), as well as α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in 25 patients (73.53%). Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82.36%). The typical feature of ground-glass opacity for adults was rare in paediatric patients (2.94%). A late-onset pattern of lesions in lobules were also noticed. Stratified analysis of the clinical features were not performed due to relatively limited samples. CONCLUSIONS Our data presented the clinical and epidemiological features of paediatric patients systemically. The findings offer new insight into the early identification and intervention of paediatric patients with COVID-19.","7ecc2bca3cfb5ebea94cd2601d6d3db60603452f","True","","Up to 9 March, 2020, 109577|disease-2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|METHODS|FINDINGS|4|China|Thirty-four|January 1 to February 25, 2020|February 28, 2020|Clinical|34|1 to 144 months|33.00|10.00|14|41.18%|47.60%|10.50|7.75|16|47.06%|76.47%|58.82%|20.59%|11.76%|11.76%|17|85.00%|17|58.62%|25|78.13%|28|82.35%|25|73.53%|28|82.36%|2.94%|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.12.20034686","biorxiv_medrxiv"
"Miguel B.

It is still early days, but using existing data we develop a large ensemble of ecological niche models that project monthly variation in climate suitability of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus throughout a typical climatological year. The current spread suggests a degree of climate determination with Coronavirus displaying preference for cool and dry conditions. The predecessor SARS-CoV was linked to similar climate conditions. Should the spread of SARS CoV-2 continue to follow current trends, a worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic is improbable. More probable is the emergence of asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks much like other respiratory diseases. People in temperate warm and cold climates are more vulnerable. Those in arid climates follow next in vulnerability, while the disease will likely marginally affect the tropics. Our projections minimize uncertainties related with spread of SARS CoV-2, providing critical information for anticipating the adequate social, economic and political responses.","e4b62ae61f0135ded00dcefd923c75ba78630ced","True","","2019-nCoV|Coronavirus|millions|Saharan Africa|monthly|Coronavirus|Coronavirus|CoV","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|PERSON|ORG|PERSON","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.12.20034728","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The immunopathological characteristics of COVID-19 patients, either systemic or local, have not been thoroughly studied. In the present study, we analyzed both the changes in the cellularity of various immune cell types as well as cytokines important for immune reactions and inflammation. Our data indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited an overall decline of lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. The number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells was moderately increased in patients with mild COVID-19. IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 were remarkably up-regulated in patients with severe COVID-19. The levels of IL-2 and IL-6 relative to the length of hospital stay underwent a similar "rise-decline" pattern, probably reflecting the therapeutic effect. In conclusion, our study shows that the comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes, and the elevation of IL-2 and IL-6 are reliable indicators of severe COVID-19.","9da357734a3bfc5b51dc2c63b6b4ab28930767ab","True","","Coronavirus|2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|IL-6|IL-10|COVID-19|IL-6|IL-6|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.12.20034736","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak. Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of a rapid spread of awareness on the use of self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden.

There is no report about the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients untill now. We aimed to describe the clinical course, outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 and prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients. Methods In this multi-center survey, cross-sectional survey, observational study, the clinical data of CML patients with COVID-19 in each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to complete a questionnaire,from February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc) during the epidemic. Additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. We described and analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, and focus on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Data were compared between the CML patients with optimal response and those with non-optimal response. The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, as of Feb 21, 2020. Secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of CML patients, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 . Findings Of 392 respondents, 223( 56.9%) were males, and 240( 61.2%) were 50 years or younger. Only 10 patients took drugs irregularly due to the influence of the epidemic because of traffic control, pharmacies unable to operate normally, etc. In the history of epidemiology, there were 4 patients with definite contact with COVID-19, of which 3 were remote contact and 1 was close contact. 12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the epidemic, 1 case (common type) was confirmed with COVID-19 and cured after treatment. 1 patient was clinically diagnosed and succumbed. 1 of 299 (0.3%) patients with an optimal response was diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 50 patients who failed to respond to CML treatment or had a poor response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Interpretation While the 392 CML respondents required regular referrals to hospitals, they did not have much contact with COVID-19 patients during the outbreak. Patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to CML therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. Older patients with comorbidities are at increased risk of death.","bab88fad90f0f0448f75af01145e2f1b90412527","True","","late December 2019|COVID-19|Wuhan|China|more than 100|February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19|Feb 21, 2020|392|223|56.9%|240|61.2%|50 years|Only 10|4|COVID-19|3|1|12|1|COVID-19|1|1|299|0.3%|COVID-19|50|1|2%|COVID-19|392","medrvix","","","","DATE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.12.20034876","biorxiv_medrxiv"

This disease is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and uncontrolled cytokine storm, but it remains unknown as to whether a robust antibody response is related to clinical deterioration and poor outcome in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients from a single center in Wuhan. Median IgG and IgM levels in acute and convalescent-phase sera (within 35 days) for all included patients were calculated and compared among severe and nonsevere patients. Immune response phenotyping based on late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratify patients with different disease severities and outcome. Laboratory parameters in patients with different immune response phenotypes and disease severities were analyzed. Findings: A total of 222 patients were included in this study. IgG was first detected on day 4 of illness, and its peak levels occurred in the fourth week. Severe cases were more frequently found in patients with high IgG levels, compared to those who with low IgG levels (51.8% versus 32.3%; p=0.008). Severity rates for patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlo phenotype was 72.3%, 48.5%, 33.3%, and 15.6%, respectively (p<0.0001). Furthermore, severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo had higher proinflammatory cytokines levels including IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10, and decreased CD4+ T cell count compared to those with NLRloIgGlo phenotype (p<0.05). Recovery rate for severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlo phenotype was 58.8% (20/34), 68.8% (11/16), 80.0% (4/5), and 100% (12/12), respectively (p=0.0592). Dead cases only occurred in NLRhiIgGhi and NLRhiIgGlo phenotypes. Interpretation: COVID-19 severity is associated with increased IgG response, and an immune response phenotyping based on late IgG response and NLR could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients, and further predict their clinical outcome.","97e0efc17b5a10c75f7c83b08423d27585a31df5","True","","2019|COVID-19|coronavirus-2|COVID-19|IgG|IgM|CLIA|COVID-19|Wuhan|IgG|IgM|35 days|IgG|222|IgG|first|day 4|the fourth week|IgG|IgG|51.8%|32.3%|NLRhiIgGhi|NLRhiIgGlo|NLRloIgGhi|NLRloIgGlo|72.3%|48.5%|33.3%|15.6%|NLRhiIgGhi,|NLRhiIgGlo|IL-2|IL-6|IL-10|NLRloIgGlo|NLRhiIgGhi|NLRhiIgGlo|NLRloIgGhi|NLRloIgGlo|58.8%|68.8%|11/16|80.0%|4/5|100%|12/12|NLRhiIgGhi|NLRhiIgGlo|IgG|IgG|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|NORP|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|NORP|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|NORP|NORP|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.12.20035048","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Results: A total of 822 participants completed questionnaires correctly. (response rate of 95.80% ). The overall prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms were 33.73%, and 29.35%, respectively. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), family members (that is, HCWs) directly contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients (OR=1.477, 95%CI:1.069-2.040) were risk factors for GAD, while higher participants self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs (OR=0.807, 95%CI:0.700-0.930) was a protective factor. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), longer average working times per week for family members (that is, HCWs) (OR=1.017, 95%CI:1.005-1.029), being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms (OR=3.526, 95%CI:1.609-7.728 and OR=1.639, 95%CI:1.096-2.451, respectively). In addition, compared with participants who were HCWs, participants who were enterprise workers and were more likely to develop depressive symptoms(OR=1.750, 95%CI:1.104-2.776), while who were government employees or institutions employees were less likely to suffer depressive symptoms (OR=0.529, 95%CI:0.286-0.977). Conclusions: Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our findings provide strong evidence to pay more attention on the mental health status of this vulnerable but often unseen populations during COVID-19 epidemic.","57a86b3acd182c955877afd4792719a4e9a0ac32","True","","COVID-19|China|Designated Hospitals|Ningbo|China|Method|five|Ningbo|China|between February 10th and 20th, 2020|COVID-19|Chinese|Patient Health Questionnare-9|PHQ-9|Chinese|Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7|GAD-7|822|95.80%|GAD|33.73%|29.35%|OR=1.215|95%CI:1.061|COVID-19|OR=1.477|95%CI:1.069-2.040|GAD|OR=0.807|95%CI:0.700-0.930|hours|COVID-19|OR=1.215|95%CI:1.061|95%CI:1.005-1.029|95%CI:1.609|OR=1.639|95%CI:1.096|95%CI:1.104|OR=0.529|95%CI:0.286|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|NORP|ORG|DATE|NORP|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|QUANTITY|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|TIME|PERSON|GPE|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.13.20033290","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Reproductive trends and the stability of the SARS-COV-2 infection in a city can then be analyzed, and the uncontrollable risks can be forecasted before they really happen. The infection mechanism of a city is depicted using the philosophy of cybernetics and approaches of the control engineering. Distinguished with other epidemiological models, such as SIR, SEIR, etc., that compute the theoretical number of infected people in a closed population, CDIM considers the immigration and emigration population as system inputs, and administrative and medical resources as dynamic control variables. The epidemic regulation can be simulated in the model to support the decision-making for containing the outbreak.

The epidemiological reports now focus on the confirmed COVID-19 cases, and we aim to assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of public health emergencies into the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods One month into the outbreak, on Feb 20/21, 2020, we sampled 369 adults on the eight dimensions of health (SF12), distress (K6), and life satisfaction in 64 cities that varied in their densities of coronavirus confirmed cases. The participants also reported their work status, whether they had chronic health issues, the number of hours they exercised per day in the past week. Findings In general, life of normal adults was severely disrupted. 33% of the participants had not left their home at all during the one-month period due to the restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 in China. 27% of the participants worked at office; 38% resorted to working from home; and 25% suspended working due to the outbreak. Those who suspended working reported worse health conditions by SF12 as well as distress (K6). The severity of the COVID-19 in individuals location predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by the existing chronic health issues and exercising hour of each individual. Interpretation Our findings support the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not affected by the virus epistemologically. We need to support especially people who suspended working during the outbreak. Our results also highlight that people who are usually active, as indicated by more exercises, might be more suspectable to wellbeing issues due to the lockdown. Policymakers who are thinking of introducing measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and welling implications.","aa5475eb5aa3a1091fa01df00aca2f3def543f70","True","","COVID-19|China|one month|COVID-19|China|One month|Feb 20/21, 2020|369|eight|64|hours|the past week|33%|one-month|China|27%|38%|25%","medrvix","","","","ORG|GPE|DATE|ORG|GPE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|TIME|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.13.20034496","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Changsha, a city located south to the epicenter, was soon impacted. To control the transmission of the coronavirus and avoid nosocomial infection, triage procedures based on epidemiology were implemented in a local hospital of the city. This retrospective study analyzed the data collected during the triage period and found that COVID-19 patients were enriched seven folds into the Section A designated for rapid detection and quarantine. On the other side, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the Section B for patients without obvious epidemiological history. Eight COVID-19 cases were spotted out of 247 suspected patients. More than 50% of the suspected patients were submitted to multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 239 patients who were diagnosed as negative of the virus infection,188 were successfully revisited and none was reported as a COVID-19 case. Of the eight COVID-19 patients, three were confirmed only after multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis. Besides comorbidities, delayed sharing of epidemiological history added another layer of complexity to the diagnosis in practice.

We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions.

The dissemination of COVID-19 was simulated using computational experiments to identify the mechanisms underlying the impact of city and residential lockdowns on controlling the spread of the epidemic. Results: The implementation of measures to lock down cities led to higher mortality rates in these cities, due to reduced mobility. Moreover, implementing city lockdown along with addition of hospital beds led to improved cure and reduced mortality rates. Stringent implementation and early lockdown of residential units effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, and reduced the number of hospital bed requirements. Collectively, measures to lock down cities and residential units should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, medical resources should be increased in cities under lockdown. Implementation of these measures would reduce the spread of the virus to other cities and allow appropriate treatment of patients in cities under lockdown.","80df1ce37238d763d313bcd0e673716c7c4458c1","True","","2019|COVID-19|SAIRD|COVID-19|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.13.20035253","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Pear Hossain; Alvin Junus; Xiaolin Zhu; Pengfei Jia; Tzai-Hung Wen; Dirk Pfeiffer; Hsiang-Yu Yuan","The effects of border control and quarantine measures on global spread of COVID-19","The rapid expansion of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world. Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. We have developed an “easy-to-use” mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R0 = 2.92 and latent period τ = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.","7677310b4e43cfaff6fd4ad53636fa80de589fd2","True","","10|Wuhan|China|first|2.92|5.2 days|32.5|44.0 days|R0|1.4|R0|2.92|10 extra days","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.13.20035261","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been widely pandemic all over the world. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence factors of death risk among 200 COVID-19 patients. Methods. Two hundred patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited. Demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected from electronic medical records. Biochemical indexes on admission were measured and patient's prognosis was tracked. The association of demographic data, clinical characteristics and biochemical indexes with death risk was analyzed. Results. Of 200 COVID-19 patients, 163 (81.5%) had at least one of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and others. Among all patients, critical cases, defined as oxygenation index lower than 200, accounted for 26.2%. Severe cases, oxygenation index from 200 to 300, were 29.7%. Besides, common cases, oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted for 44.1%. At the end of follow-up, 34 (17%) were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Stratified analysis revealed that older ages, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. On admission, 85.5% COVID-19 patients were with at least one of extrapulmonary organ injuries. Univariable logistic regression showed that ALT and TBIL, two indexes of hepatic injury, AST, myoglobin and LDH, AST/ALT ratio, several markers of myocardial injury, creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, three indexes of renal injury, were positively associated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion. Older age, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities on admission elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients. AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission may be potential prognostic indicators. Early hospitalization is of great significance to prevent multiple organ damage and improve the survival of COVID-19 patients.","","False","","Coronavirus|2019|COVID-19|coronavirus-2|200|Two|hundred|Demographic|200|163|81.5%|at least one|200|26.2%|200 to 300|29.7%|higher than 300|44.1%|34|17%|10.9 day|COVID-19|85.5%|at least one|ALT|TBIL|two|AST|LDH|AST|ALT|three|COVID-19|AST|ALT|TBIL|LDH|COVID-19|COVID-19|AST|ALT|TBIL|LDH|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|DATE|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.13.20035329","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidemic. Thus, serious supervision of domestic transport networks is warranted even after restricting international migration.","ee3aa97a0ad91231296bd0643136c83bb97af88a","True","","2019-nCov|SIR|two|first|second|Indian|more than 300|90 days","medrvix","","","","CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.13.20035386","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Based on epidemic data from China we constructed and constrained a simple Susceptible-Infected-Infectious-Excluded (SIIE) model. The model is characterized by only three parameters: average incubation period, contact rate rC, and exclusion rate rE. These two rates control the daily multiplication coefficient β describing epidemic growth in its early exponential phase, during which the number of excluded (confirmed) individuals grows as E = E0 exp(α,t) with α = lnβ. The rates can be modified by non-therapeutic interventions: rC can be reduced by quarantine, while rE can be increased by efficient testing, enabling isolation of infectious individuals. In order to contain exponential epidemic growth, quotient rC/rE has to be reduced to 1. Based on the model, we estimate that the quarantine imposed in China on January 23, 2020 resulted in about 50-fold reduction of this quotient, allowing to terminate the exponential growth phase and enter the phase of exponential regression of daily new cases. In contrast, quarantine imposed in northern, most affected, Italian provinces on February 21 resulted in about 3-fold reduction of rC/rE and corresponding decrease of β from about 1.5 to about 1.2; further 5-fold reduction is necessary to terminate exponential growth. Even higher reduction should take place in France, Germany and Spain for which β > 1.3 (as of March 10, 2020). Considering longer-term dynamics in the case when the initial exponential growth is not contained by quarantine, we analyzed a scenario in which rE decreases in response to the surge of daily new cases which convinces people to isolate themselves. In such case, initial abrupt epidemic growth is followed by a slow decrease over years. This scenario, although economically and socially devastating, grants time to develop, produce, and distribute vaccine.","3c0e6714183f9935f79f8b2e2a708833b52f00e0","True","","March 2020|Coronavirus Disease|2019|Wuhan|China|China|Susceptible|SIIE|only three|rC|two|daily|exp(α,t|rC/rE|1|China|January 23, 2020|daily|Italian|February 21|about 3-fold|rC/rE|about 1.5|about 1.2|5-fold|France|Germany|Spain|1.3|March 10, 2020","medrvix","","","","DATE|ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|LANGUAGE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|NORP|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE","medrxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.13.20035485","biorxiv_medrxiv"

In January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Interest (PHEI). Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a COVID-19 epidemic in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We used a generalized SEIR (Susceptibles, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model, with additional Hospitalized variables (SEIHR model) and age-stratified structure to analyze the expected time evolution during the onset of the epidemic in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo. The model allows to determine the evolution of the number of cases, the number of patients admitted to hospitals and deaths caused by COVID-19. In order to investigate the sensibility of our results with respect to parameter estimation errors we performed Monte Carlo analysis with 100 000 simulations by sampling parameter values from an uniform distribution in the confidence interval. Results: We estimate 1 368 (IQR: 880, 2 407) cases, 301 (22%) in older people (more than 60 years), 81 (50, 143) hospitalizations, and 14 (9, 26) deaths in the first 30 days, and 38 583 (IQR: 16 698, 113, 163) cases, 8 427 (21.8%) in older people (more than 60 years), 2181 (914, 6392) hospitalizations, and 397(166, 1205) deaths in the first 60 days. Limitations: We supposed a constant transmission probability Pc among different age-groups, and that every severe and critic case will be hospitalized, as well as that the detection capacity in all the primary healthcare services does not change during the outbreak. Conclusion: Supposing the reported parameters in the literature apply in the city of Sao Paulo, our study shows that it is expected that the impact of a COVID-19 outbreak will be important, requiring special planning from the authorities. This is the first study for a major metropolitan center in the south hemisphere, and we believe it can provide policymakers with a prognosis of the burden of the pandemic not only in Brazil, but also in other tropical zones, allowing to estimate total cases, hospitalization, and deaths, in support to the management of the public health emergence caused by COVID-19.","3701cb3b329a07d9e6fe1986584be12f5eafe111","True","","January 2020|China|the World Health Organization|Wuhan|Hubei|January 30, 2020|the World Health Organization|COVID-19|International Interest|PHEI|COVID-19|Sao Paulo|Brazil|SEIR|Susceptibles|Exposed|Infectious|Hospitalized|Sao Paulo|Monte Carlo|100|1 368|880|2 407|301|22%|more than 60 years|81|50|143|14|9|26|the first 30 days|38 583|16 698|113|163|8 427|21.8%|more than 60 years|2181|914|397(166|1205|the first 60 days|Sao Paulo|COVID-19|first|Brazil|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","DATE|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|ORG|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|GPE|ORG|ORDINAL|GPE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.14.20035873","biorxiv_medrxiv"

However a reliable estimation of the number of infected, including asymptomatic people, turns out to be crucial in the preparation of operational schemes and to estimate the future number of people, who will require, to different extents, medical attentions. In order to overcome the current data shortcoming, this paper proposes a bootstrap driven, estimation procedure for the number of people infected with the SARSCoV2. This method is designed to be robust, automatic and suitable to generate estimations at regional level. Obtained results show that, while official data at March the 12th report 12.839 cases in Italy, people infected wiyh the SARSCoV2 could be as high as 105.789.","b5f172f9c5db90d48f5f4f281bab76e1401f1a36","True","","the Italian Government|March|12th|12.839|Italy|105.789","medrvix","","","","ORG|DATE|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL","medrxiv","2020-03-18","","10.1101/2020.03.14.20036103","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Mass migration prior to the Chinese New Year may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 across China. This analysis investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020. Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan. Results: Cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P<0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020. Conclusions: Outflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics. The travel ban led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 outside of Wuhan.","1c02f14de3ae4c5e26600b073ec6396caefb3830","True","","Wuhan|2019|Chinese|the Chinese New Year|China|between daily|Wuhan|COVID-19|31|Chinese|January-February 2020|National and Provincial Health Committee|January 10 to February 29, 2020|Wuhan|Baidu|ARIMA|COVID-19|COVID-19|Wuhan|Wuhan|0.22-0.78|Approximately 42%|1 week|COVID-19|39%|1 week|19%|2-3 weeks|Migration|Wuhan|Wuhan|approximately 19,768|95%|CI|13,589|25,946|Wuhan|February 29, 2020|Wuhan|China|COVID-19|Wuhan","medrvix","","","","GPE|DATE|NORP|EVENT|GPE|DATE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|DATE|ORG|DATE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|NORP|GPE","medrxiv","2020-03-17","","10.1101/2020.03.15.20034199","biorxiv_medrxiv"

The mortality of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in severe and critical cases is very high. Facing this kind of public health emergency, high efficient administrative emergency responsive mode in designated hospital is needed. Method: As an affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, our hospital is the only designated one for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Zhuhai, a medium-sized city. Novel coronavirus pneumonia department, which is administrative led by the president of hospital directly, has been established at early stage of epidemic crisis in my hospital. In NCP department, there are core members of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) specialist and multidisciplinary team. Don't stick to national guidelines of NCP, based on professional opinion by respiratory professor and expert group, we focused on individualized treatment and timely adjustment of treatment and management strategies in working about COVID-19 patients. Results: 1. High working efficiency: By Mar 02, 2020, we have completed 2974 citywide consultations and treatment of 366 inpatients, including 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. 2. Excellent therapeutic effect：Among 101 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, all were cured and discharged, except for one death. No secondary hospital infection, no pipeline infection and no pressure sore were found in all patients. 3. Finding and confirming person-to-person transmission characteristic of COVID-19 prior to official release conference: Strengthened protection is key point to zero infection in healthcare group and medical faculty and lower rate of second generation infectious patients. 4. Timely adjustment management and treatment strategy prior to guideline update: The first evidence of digestive tract involvement in COVID-19 has been found, and the earliest clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 has been carried out in our hospital. Conclusions: In our hospital, establishment of NCP department, which is administratively led by the president of hospital directly and specialized conduct by respiratory professor, is the key to success in management and treatment of COVID-19 patients.

"Vageesh Jain; Jin-Min Yuan","Systematic review and meta-analysis of predictive symptoms and comorbidities for severe COVID-19 infection","Background/introduction COVID−19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID−19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID−19 severity. Method This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID−19 infection or ICU admission. Results Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID−19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 − 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 − 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 − 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 − 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 − 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 − 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity. Conclusions Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID−19.","179df1e769292dd113cef1b54b0b43213e6b5c97","True","","China|Method|PROSPERO|three|MEDLINE|EMBASE|5th|March 2020|Two|STROBE|ICU|2259|42|7|1813|ICU|62.4 years|ICU|46 years|67.2%|57.1%|Dyspnoea|pOR|3.70|95%|CI|1.83|7.46|ICU|pOR 6.55|95%|CI|4.28|10.0|COPD|ICU|4.5%|9.7%|COPD|pOR 6.42|95%|CI|− 16.9|ICU|95%|CI|6.56|48.2|ICU|CVD|4.4|95%|CI 2.64|7.47|3.7 (|95%|CI|2.22|ICU|Conclusions Dyspnoea|ICU|ICU-|COPD","medrvix","","","","GPE|PERSON|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|FAC|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-16","","10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360","biorxiv_medrxiv"

Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted nowcasting.","9b4445849937393a4b05378653521a9d0c34dc8e","True","","COVID-19|older ages|Italy|South Korea|COVID-19","medrvix","","","","ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|ORG","medrxiv","2020-03-18","","10.1101/2020.03.15.20036293","biorxiv_medrxiv"

In this study, we examined Rt of COVID-19 and compared its transmissibility between different intervention periods in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Methods: Daily aggregated counts of confirmed imported and local cases between January 1, 2020 and March 13, 2020 were analysed. A likelihood function was constructed to estimate Rt, accounting for imported cases. Results: Although Hangzhou had fewer number of cases than Shenzhen, Shenzhen had higher proportion of imported cases than Hangzhou (83% vs 29%). Since the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen was dominated by imported cases, Rt was kept below unity through time. On the contrary, Rt was greater than unity in Hangzhou from 16 January to 7 February due to the surge in local cases. Credits to the Wuhan lockdown and outbreak response measures following the local lockdown, Rt decreased steadily and dropped below unity in mid-February. Conclusion: The lockdown measures and local outbreak responses helped reduce the potential of local transmission in Hangzhou and Shenzhen.

Methods We retrieved GT data for the specific locations of Taiwan nationwide and subregions using defined search terms related to coronavirus, handwashing, and face masks. Results Searches related to COVID-19 and face masks in Taiwan increased rapidly, following the announcements of Taiwan’ first imported case and reached its peak as local cases were reported. However, searches for handwashing were gradually increased in period of face masks shortage. Moreover, high to moderate correlations between Google relative search volume (RSV) and COVID-19 cases were found in Taipei (lag-3), New Taipei (lag-2), Taoyuan (lag-2), Tainan (lag-1), Taichung (lag0), and Kaohsiung (lag0). Conclusion In response to the ongoing outbreak, our results demonstrated that GT could potentially define the proper timing and location for practicing appropriate risk communication strategies to the affected population.","241dbe189937800ffeddfdafbac58ceec96948d3","True","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","COVID-19|at least 26|Google Trends|COVID-19|Taiwan|Taiwan|COVID-19|Taiwan|Taiwan’|first|Google|RSV|COVID-19|Taipei|New Taipei|Taoyuan|Tainan|Taichung|Kaohsiung","els-covid","#7747","","","ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|LOC|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-12","","10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.021","custom_license"

Aims The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 infection patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. Methods A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of sciences until February 25, 2020. Risk ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Results Eight studies were included in the meta- analysis, including 46248 infected patients. The result showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever ( 91 ± 3, 95% CI 86-97% ), followed by cough (67 ± 7, 95% CI 59-76%), fatigue ( 51 ± 0, 95% CI 34-68% ) and dyspnea ( 30 ± 4, 95% CI 21-40%). The most prevalent comorbidity were hypertension (17 ± 7, 95% CI 14-22%) and diabetes ( 8 ± 6, 95% CI 6-11% ), followed by cardiovascular diseases ( 5 ± 4, 95% CI 4-7% ) and respiratory system disease( 2 ± 0, 95% CI 1-3% ). Compared with the Non-severe patient, the pooled odds ratio of hypertension, respiratory system disease, cardiovascular disease in severe patients were (OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.46-3.83), (OR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.76-3.44) and (OR 3.42, 95% CI: 1.88-6.22)respectively. Conclusion We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 infection patients and found underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular, may be a risk factor for severe patients compared with Non-severe patients.","4090d8537051fae501355bc567dc2dec620762eb","True","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","Novel Coronavirus|Wuhan|China|COVID-19|PubMed|EMBASE|February 25, 2020|95%|Eight|46248|91 ± 3|95%|CI|86-97%|67|95%|CI 59-76%|51|±|95%|CI|34-68%|30|± 4|95%|CI 21-40%|17|95%|CI|14-22%|8|95%|CI 6-11%|5|95%|CI|4-7%|2|95%|CI 1-3%|Non-|95%|CI|1.46-3.83|2.46|95%|CI|1.76|3.44|3.42|95%|CI|1.88|COVID-19|Non","els-covid","#8189","","","ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|TIME|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-12","","10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.017","custom_license"

Design This was a retrospective, multicenter clinical study. Setting This study used a multicenter dataset from 4 hospitals in Wuhan, China. Participants Patients and health care providers with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV from January 23 to 31, 2020, at the Wuhan Union Hospital, the Wuhan Children's Hospital, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, and the Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China. Interventions Anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted and applied in 4 hospitals in Wuhan. Measurements and Main Results Cross-infection in the operating rooms of the 4 hospitals was effectively reduced by implementing the new measures and procedures. The majority of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or suspected infection were female (23 [62%] of 37), and the mean age was 41.0 years old (standard deviation 19.6; range 4-78). 10 (27%) patients had chronic medical illnesses, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease. Twenty-five (68%) patients presented with lymphopenia, and 23 (62%) patients exhibited multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on computed tomography scanning. Conclusions The present study indicates that COVID 19–specific guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV may effectively prevent cross-infection in the operating room. Most patients with confirmed or suspected COVID 19 presented with fever and dry cough and demonstrated bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest computed tomography scans.","194a486fcdbc56b34192242ddf973dc3a313dc1d","True","Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia","2019|2019-nCoV|4|Wuhan|China|2019-nCoV|January 23 to 31, 2020|the Wuhan Union Hospital|the Wuhan Children's Hospital|The Central Hospital|Wuhan|the Wuhan Fourth Hospital|Wuhan|China|Anesthetic|2019-nCoV|4|Wuhan|Main Results Cross|4|2019-nCoV|23|62%|37|41.0 years old|19.6|4|10|27%|4|11%|8 (22%|8 (22%|Twenty-five|68%|23|62%|2019-nCoV|COVID 19","els-covid","#2485","","","DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|GPE|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-02-28","2883079614","10.1053/j.jvca.2020.02.039","custom_license"

Genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from patients with pneumonia identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the etiology (1). As of February 4, 2020, approximately 20,000 confirmed cases had been identified in China and an additional 159 confirmed cases in 23 other countries, including 11 in the United States (2,3). On January 17, CDC and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection began health screenings at U.S. airports to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City (4). CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a process for inquiries regarding persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection (2). As of January 31, 2020, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from public health officials and health care providers to assist in evaluating approximately 650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection. Guided by CDC criteria for the evaluation of persons under investigation (PUIs) (5), 210 symptomatic persons were tested for 2019-nCoV; among these persons, 148 (70%) had travel-related risk only, 42 (20%) had close contact with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or PUI, and 18 (9%) had both travel- and contact-related risks. Eleven of these persons had laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Recognizing persons at risk for 2019-nCoV is critical to identifying cases and preventing further transmission. Health care providers should remain vigilant and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices when evaluating patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection (6). Providers should consult with their local and state health departments when assessing not only ill travelers from 2019-nCoV-affected countries but also ill persons who have been in close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in the United States.","80a03c5cca3549c6bedad185f73950ce1213bf1b","True","MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep","December 2019|Wuhan City|China|Hubei Province|Genetic|2019-nCoV|1|February 4, 2020|approximately 20,000|China|159|23|11|the United States|2,3|January 17|CDC|the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's|Customs and Border Protection|U.S.|Wuhan City|4|CDC|Emergency Operations Center|January 21|2019-nCoV|2|January 31, 2020|CDC|approximately 650|2019-nCoV|CDC|5|210|2019-nCoV|148|70%|42 (|20%|2019-nCoV|PUI|18|9%|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|6|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|the United States","cc-by","#830","PMC7017962","32053579","DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE","PMC","2020 Feb 14","3004490697","10.15585/mmwr.mm6906e1","custom_license"

Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs. We determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.","b3940a8e9cd829a3346f913119efdb1ffcd8ec77","True","Cell","90,000|>3,000|Coronavirus|CoV S|S1/S2|CoV","els-covid","#5754","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|GPE|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-03-09","","10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058","custom_license"

Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis, B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. In vitro, recombinant B38-CAP protein catalyzed the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1–7, as well as other known ACE2 target peptides. Treatment with B38-CAP suppressed angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice. Moreover, B38-CAP inhibited pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction in mice. Our data identify the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a human ACE2-like enzyme.

Design and methods Data from 51 laboratory-confirmed patients were retrospectively analyzed. Results The incubation period in the tertiary group was longer than that in the imported and secondary groups (both P < 0.05). Fever was the most common symptom at the onset of illness (73.33%, 58.82%, and 68.42%, respectively), and half of the patients had a low-grade temperature (<38.0℃) with a short duration of fever (<7 days). The CT scan showed that most patients had bilateral pneumonia in the three groups (80.00%, 76.47%, and 73.68%, respectively). Ct values detected from the tertiary patients were similar to those from the imported and secondary groups at the time of admission (both P > 0.05). For the tertiary group, the viral load was undetectable for half of the patients (52.63%) on day 7, and all patients on day 14. For 1/3rd of the patients in the imported and secondary groups, the viral load remained positive on day 14 after the admission.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) towards respiratory tract infections (RTIs) prevention among Malaysian Hajj pilgrims. METHODS: This study was conducted among Malaysian Umrah pilgrims in Malaysia from Kuala Lumpur and Kelantan. The questionnaire then underwent a series of validation process that included content, face validity and exploratory part. Item response theory (IRT) analysis was utilized for the validation of the knowledge domain. The attitude and practice were validated using the exploratory factor analysis (EFA). RESULTS: The validation process resulted in a questionnaire that comprised of four main sections: demography, knowledge, attitude, and practice. Following IRT analysis of the knowledge domain, all items analyzed were within the acceptable range of difficulty and discrimination. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO) was 0.72 and 0.84 for attitude and practice domain respectively and Bartlett’s test of Sphericity for both domains were highly significant (P < 0.001). The factor analysis resulted in two factors with total of 12 items in attitude domain, and 2 factors with total of 13 items in the practice domain with satisfactory factor loading (> 0.3). The Cronbach’s alpha for reliability of the knowledge, attitude and practice domains all showed acceptable values of > 0.6 (0.92, 0.77 and 0.85). CONCLUSION: The findings of this validation and reliability study showed that the developed questionnaire had a satisfactory psychometric property for measuring KAP of Malaysian Hajj pilgrims.","7fb385f3c0c5ce04f1c3d3c4f20678c0ae3a7031","True","BMC Public Health","Hajj|KAP|Malaysian|Hajj|Malaysian|Umrah|Malaysia|Kuala Lumpur|Kelantan|four|The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin|KMO|0.72|0.84|Bartlett|0.001|two|12|2|13|0.3|Cronbach|0.6 (|0.92|0.77|0.85|KAP|Malaysian|Hajj","cc-by","#3234","PMC7050115","32114986","PERSON|PERSON|NORP|PERSON|NORP|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|LOC|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|NORP|PERSON","PMC","2020 Mar 2","","10.1186/s12889-020-8269-9","comm_use_subset"

DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline and PsycINFO were searched from inception until December 2018. Reference lists and Google Scholar were also handsearched. RESULTS: Twenty-six papers published from database inception to December 2018 were reviewed. A wide range of psychological and non-psychological outcomes were reported. There was a marked trend for isolated patients to exhibit higher levels of depression, the pooled standardised mean difference being 1.28 (95% CI 0.47 to 2.09) and anxiety 1.45 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.34), although both had high levels of heterogeneity, and worse outcomes for a range of care-related factors but with significant variation. CONCLUSION: The review indicates that isolation to contain the risk of infection has negative consequences for segregated patients. Although strength of the evidence is weak, comprising primarily single-centre convenience samples, consistency of the effects may strengthen this conclusion. More research needs to be undertaken to examine this relationship and develop and test interventions to reduce the negative effects of isolation.","a3b5e995f19fca615af9084f08e562b563a74085; 21a19241ff8c8602a9cd610ceea62e746a6493e2","True","BMJ Open","Medline|PsycINFO|December 2018|Google Scholar|Twenty-six|December 2018|1.28|95%|CI|0.47|2.09|95%|CI|2.34","cc-by-nc","","PMC7044903","32075820","PERSON|DATE|DATE|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL","PMC","2020 Feb 18","","10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030371","noncomm_use_subset"
"Wysocki, Jan; Schulze, Arndt; Batlle, Daniel","Novel Variants of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 of Shorter Molecular Size to Target the Kidney Renin Angiotensin System","ACE2 is a monocarboxypeptidase which generates Angiotensin (1–7) from Angiotensin II (1–8). Attempts to target the kidney Renin Angiotensin System using native ACE2 to treat kidney disease are hampered by its large molecular size, 100 kDa, which precludes its glomerular filtration and subsequent tubular uptake. Here, we show that both urine and kidney lysates are capable of digesting native ACE2 into shorter proteins of ~60–75 kDa and then demonstrate that they are enzymatically very active. We then truncated the native ACE2 by design from the C-terminus to generate two short recombinant (r)ACE2 variants (1-605 and 1-619AA). These two truncates have a molecular size of ~70 kDa, as expected from the amino acid sequence and as shown by Western blot. ACE2 enzyme activity, measured using a specific substrate, was higher than that of the native rACE2 (1-740 AA). When infused to mice with genetic ACE2 deficiency, a single i.v. injection of 1-619 resulted in detectable ACE2 activity in urine, whereas infusion of the native ACE2 did not. Moreover, ACE2 activity was recovered in harvested kidneys from ACE2-deficient mice infused with 1-619, but not in controls (23.1 ± 4.3 RFU/µg creatinine/h and 1.96 ± 0.73 RFU/µg protein/hr, respectively). In addition, the kidneys of ACE2-null mice infused with 1-619 studied ex vivo formed more Ang (1–7) from exogenous Ang II than those infused with vehicle (AUC 8555 ± 1933 vs. 3439 ± 753 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.05) further demonstrating the functional effect of increasing kidney ACE2 activity after the infusion of our short ACE2 1-619 variant. We conclude that our novel short recombinant ACE2 variants undergo glomerular filtration, which is associated with kidney uptake of enzymatically active proteins that can enhance the formation of Ang (1–7) from Ang II. These small ACE2 variants may offer a potentially useful approach to target kidney RAS overactivity to combat kidney injury.","c56e3599cec6dd5161af736e9d9cbd0e58c86315","True","Biomolecules","Angiotensin|1–7|Angiotensin II|Renin Angiotensin System|100|~60–75 kDa|two|1-605|1|two|rACE2|1-619|1-619|23.1|± 4.3|1.96|1-619|Ang|1–7|Ang II|AUC|± 1933|3439|753|0.05|1|Ang|1–7|Ang II|RAS","cc-by","","PMC6995632","31861139","GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|MONEY|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 17","","10.3390/biom9120886","comm_use_subset"

The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. Methods In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike. Results Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain β (SBDβ). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDβ of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. Conclusions We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol.

A repeat dengue rapid test was positive for dengue IgM and IgG (Dengue Combo; Wells Bio, South Korea). He was referred to hospital for dengue with worsening cough and dyspnoea. A chest radiograph led to testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (in-house laboratory-developed test detecting the N and ORF1ab genes) from a nasopharyngeal swab, which returned positive. The original seropositive sample and additional urine and blood samples tested negative for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses by RT-PCR,3 , 4 , 5 and a repeat dengue rapid test (SD Bioline) was also negative.

Objective: Based on death notification data from Antananarivo, the capital city of Madagascar, this study assesses seasonal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality by age groups and evaluates how these patterns changed over the period 1976–2015. Methods: Monthly numbers of deaths by cause were obtained from death registers maintained by the Municipal Hygiene Office in charge of verifying deaths before the issuance of burial permits. Generalized Additive Mixed regression models (GAMM) were used to test for seasonality in mortality and its changes over the last four decades, controlling for long-term trends in mortality. Results: Among children, risks of dying were the highest during the hot and rainy season, but seasonality in child mortality has significantly declined since the mid-1970s, as a result of declines in the burden of infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies. In adults aged 60 and above, all-cause mortality rates are the highest in the dry and cold season, due to peaks in cardiovascular diseases, with little change over time. Overall, changes in the seasonality of all-cause mortality have been driven by shifts in the hierarchy of causes of death, while changes in the seasonality within broad categories of causes of death have been modest. Conclusion: Shifts in disease patterns brought about by the epidemiological transition, rather than changes in seasonal variation in cause-specific mortality, are the main drivers of trends in the seasonality of all-cause mortality.","52d222becd8912fcd1a81cf956a18f88b738c2ee","True","Glob Health Action","Sub-Saharan Africa|Antananarivo|Madagascar|1976–2015|Monthly|the Municipal Hygiene Office|Generalized Additive Mixed|the last four decades|the mid-1970s|seasonal","cc-by","","PMC7034494","32027239","GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|DATE","PMC","2020 Feb 6","","10.1080/16549716.2020.1717411","comm_use_subset"

So far, most published studies identified host factors primarily for single pathogens. Furthermore, often only a small subset of genes, e.g., genes encoding kinases, have been targeted. Identification of host factors on a pan-pathogen level, i.e., genes that are crucial for the replication of a diverse group of pathogens has received relatively little attention, despite the fact that such common host factors would be highly relevant, for instance, for devising broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic drugs. Here, we present a novel two-stage procedure for the identification of host factors involved in the replication of different viruses using a combination of random effects models and Markov random walks on a functional interaction network. We first infer candidate genes by jointly analyzing multiple perturbations screens while at the same time adjusting for high variance inherent in these screens. Subsequently the inferred estimates are spread across a network of functional interactions thereby allowing for the analysis of missing genes in the biological studies, smoothing the effect sizes of previously found host factors, and considering a priori pathway information defined over edges of the network. We applied the procedure to RNAi screening data of four different positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, Hepatitis C virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and detected novel host factors, including UBC, PLCG1, and DYRK1B, which are predicted to significantly impact the replication cycles of these viruses. We validated the detected host factors experimentally using pharmacological inhibition and an additional siRNA screen and found that some of the predicted host factors indeed influence the replication of these pathogens.","8be9f1b18de44f61ed5a342dac1e47d12c943dca","True","PLoS Comput Biol","RNA|two|Markov|first|four|RNA|Hepatitis C|Chikungunya|Severe|UBC|PLCG1|siRNA","cc-by","#7370","PMC7034926","32040506","ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PRODUCT|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|FAC","PMC","2020 Feb 10","","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007587","comm_use_subset"

The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 28 cases were analyzed in response to this disease. METHODS: The epidemiological characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response team. RESULTS: There were 16 patients that entered Korea from foreign countries: Wuhan, China (11 patients), Zhuhai, China, (1 patient), Singapore (2 patients), Japan (1 patient), and Thailand (1 patient). The early symptoms were fever, sore throat, cough or sputum production, chills, and muscle ache. Three patients were asymptomatic, however, 18 developed pneumonia. Of the 28 cases, 16 were index cases imported from abroad, with 10 cases of secondary infection originating in Korea, and the route of transmission still under investigation for 2 patients. The 10 patients with secondary infection were infected from contact with family members or acquaintances of primary patients, and the suspected sites of transmission were mostly at home. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in Korea was spread by 16 infected individuals traveling from other countries, leading to second-generation cases. The initial symptoms were mostly minor, but the disease was infectious at this stage, resulting from close contact, particularly at home. Establishing an early detection strategy for COVID-19 is crucial for managing the transmission of the disease.","b9c4627fca08e4d363dbd7c27da40834a048a262","True","Osong Public Health Res Perspect","first|2019|COVID-19|South Korea|January 2020|28|February 14(th|2020|28|28|Korea|COVID-19|16|Korea|Wuhan|China|11|Zhuhai|China|1|Singapore|2|Japan|1|Thailand|1|Three|18|28|16|10|Korea|2|10|Korea|16|second|COVID-19","cc-by-nc-nd","#2688","PMC7045878","32149037","ORDINAL|DATE|ORG|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb","2981256933","10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.1.03","custom_license"

Although community ecology approaches have been used to identify pathogen interactions at the within-host scale, methodologies enabling robust identification of interactions from population-scale data such as that available from health authorities are lacking. To address this gap, we developed a statistical framework that jointly identifies interactions between multiple viruses from contemporaneous non-stationary infection time series. Our conceptual approach is derived from a Bayesian multivariate disease mapping framework. Importantly, our approach captures within- and between-year dependencies in infection risk while controlling for confounding factors such as seasonality, demographics and infection frequencies, allowing genuine pathogen interactions to be distinguished from simple correlations. We validated our framework using a broad range of synthetic data. We then applied it to diagnostic data available for five respiratory viruses co-circulating in a major urban population between 2005 and 2013: adenovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We found positive and negative covariances indicative of epidemiological interactions among specific virus pairs.

Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials.

In the USA, more than 500 000 people were reported to be experiencing homelessness on any given night over the past decade (2007–19).1 The State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 report2 estimated 35 000 people are experiencing homelessness on any given night in Canada. People experiencing homelessness live in environments that are conducive to a disease epidemic. Many people experiencing homelessness live in congregate living settings—be it formal (ie, shelters or halfway houses) or informal (ie, encampments or abandoned buildings)—and might not have regular access to basic hygiene supplies or showering facilities, all of which could facilitate virus transmission. People experiencing homelessness are a vulnerable group, and their potential exposure to COVID-19 might negatively affect their ability to be housed, and their mental and physical health. People experiencing homelessness aged younger than 65 years have all-cause mortality that is 5–10 times higher than that of the general population.3 COVID-19 infection might further increase this mortality disparity.","5515287c3a3fe378c53529307e9dae35f51fe7da","True","The Lancet Public Health","2|COVID-19|North America|USA|Canada|USA|more than 500|any given night|the past decade|The State of Homelessness|Canada|2016|35|any given night|Canada|COVID-19|younger than 65 years|5–10","els-covid","#6865","","","CARDINAL|PERSON|LOC|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|TIME|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|TIME|GPE|PERSON|DATE|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-11","","10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30053-0","custom_license"

We generated influenza virus reads down to a limit of detection of 10(2) to 10(3) genome copies/ml in pooled samples, observing a strong relationship between the viral titer and the proportion of influenza virus reads (P = 4.7 × 10(−5)). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs, we generated influenza virus reads for 27/27 samples with mid-to-high viral titers (cycle threshold [C(T)] values, <30) and 6/13 samples with low viral titers (C(T) values, 30 to 40). No false-positive reads were generated from 10 influenza virus-negative samples. Thus, Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 67 to 93%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 69 to 100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard. Coverage of full-length virus was dependent on sample composition, being negatively influenced by increased host and bacterial reads. However, at high influenza virus titers, we were able to reconstruct >99% complete sequences for all eight gene segments. We also detected a human coronavirus coinfection in one clinical sample. While further optimization is required to improve sensitivity, this approach shows promise for the Nanopore platform to be used in the diagnosis and genetic analysis of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses.","58657873c0bc33b6cbd816292e2d239228cde3a0","True","J Clin Microbiol","Influenza|Metagenomic|the Oxford Nanopore Technologies|10(2|10(3|4.7|27/27|30|6/13|C(T|30 to 40|10|Nanopore|83%|95%|CI|67 to 93%|100%|95%|CI|69 to 100%|99%|eight|one|Nanopore","cc-by","","PMC6935926","31666364","ORG|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE","PMC","2019 Dec 23","","10.1128/JCM.00963-19","comm_use_subset"
"Jones, Rachael M.; Bleasdale, Susan C.; Maita, Dayana; Brosseau, Lisa M.","A systematic risk-based strategy to select personal protective equipment for infectious diseases","Background Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a primary strategy to protect health care personnel (HCP) from infectious diseases. When transmission-based PPE ensembles are not appropriate, HCP must recognize the transmission pathway of the disease and anticipate the exposures to select PPE. Because guidance for this process is extremely limited, we proposed a systematic, risk-based approach to the selection and evaluation of PPE ensembles to protect HCP against infectious diseases. Methods The approach used in this study included the following 4 steps: (1) job hazard analysis, (2) infectious disease hazard analysis, (3) selection of PPE, and (4) evaluation of selected PPE. Selected PPE should protect HCP from exposure, be usable by HCP, and fit for purpose. Results The approach was demonstrated for the activity of intubation of a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. As expected, the approach led to the selection of different ensembles of PPE for these 2 pathogens. Discussion A systematic risk-based approach to the selection of PPE will help health care facilities and HCP select PPE when transmission-based precautions are not appropriate. Owing to the complexity of PPE ensemble selection and evaluation, a team with expertise in infectious diseases, occupational health, the health care activity, and related disciplines, such as human factors, should be engaged. Conclusions Participation, documentation, and transparency are necessary to ensure the decisions can be communicated, critiqued, and understood by HCP.","fd51530ed73c17ccd16690c0bfa046be2f360f7f","True","American Journal of Infection Control","PPE|HCP|PPE|HCP|PPE|PPE|HCP|4|1|2|3|PPE|4|PPE|PPE|HCP|HCP|Staphylococcus|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|PPE|2|PPE|HCP|PPE|PPE|Conclusions Participation|HCP","els-covid","#3682","","31358421","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-01-31","2964662575","10.1016/j.ajic.2019.06.023","custom_license"

Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities.

It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th(,) 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.","ab854568981d35b1da78cccdaf67b6cfd7ac0046; 6b6a3e24c4812ea75232742d0fdd0a4020289ce6; 0df0d5270a9399cf4e23c0cdd877a80616a9725e","True","Infect Dis Model","one|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|January 29th|2020|daily|daily|below 1","cc-by-nc-nd","#729","PMC7029158","32099934","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|PERCENT","PMC","2020 Feb 11","3006028839","10.1016/j.idm.2020.02.001","noncomm_use_subset"

Here, we identified S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as E3 ligase that executes lysine-48-linked poly-ubiquitination of BECN1, thus promoting its proteasomal degradation. SKP2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation in a hetero-complex involving FKBP51, PHLPP, AKT1, and BECN1. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 decreases BECN1 ubiquitination, decreases BECN1 degradation and enhances autophagic flux. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) multiplication results in reduced BECN1 levels and blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Inhibitors of SKP2 not only enhance autophagy but also reduce the replication of MERS-CoV up to 28,000-fold. The SKP2-BECN1 link constitutes a promising target for host-directed antiviral drugs and possibly other autophagy-sensitive conditions.","9235abaf9b34976f68a8d0031a94201fe371d364; 3012e3f833915e67993777c3a69d90013bff8c1e; 0a0afb5dc02afa81689e0e75afe2f9a21ce09e70","True","Nat Commun","Autophagy|Beclin1|one|S|2|SKP2|hetero|FKBP51|PHLPP|SKP2|Middle East|28,000-fold|SKP2-BECN1","cc-by","","PMC6920372","31852899","ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|LOC|CARDINAL|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 18","","10.1038/s41467-019-13659-4","comm_use_subset"

Interactions between SADS-CoV and the host innate immune response is unclear yet. In this study, we used IPEC-J2 cells as a model to explore potential evasion strategies employed by SADS-CoV. Our results showed that SADS-CoV infection failed to induce IFN-β production, and inhibited poly (I:C) and Sendai virus (SeV)-triggered IFN-β expression. SADS-CoV also blocked poly (I:C)-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3 and NF-κB. Furthermore, SADS-CoV did not interfere with the activity of IFN-β promoter stimulated by IRF3, TBK1 and IKKε, but counteracted its activation induced by IPS-1 and RIG-I. Collectively, this study is the first investigation that shows interactions between SADS-CoV and the host innate immunity, which provides information of the molecular mechanisms underlying SASD-CoV infection.","f6525bc180629aca4b0760e0ff9f187f2e2a6fec","True","Virus Research","IPEC-J2|SADS-CoV.|SADS-CoV|Sendai|CoV|CoV|IPS-1|RIG-I.|first|SADS-CoV|SASD","els-covid","#2043","","31884203","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.virusres.2019.197843","custom_license"

However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human–animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence. Policies and programmes existing in the communities provide opportunities for zoonotic risk mitigation. CONCLUSIONS: This study explored the relationship among zoonotic risk and human behaviour, environment and policies in rural communities in southern China. It identifies key behavioural risk factors that can be targeted for development of tailored risk-mitigation strategies to reduce the threat of novel zoonoses.","4b36607cdbc54f8006161a9a1839489dd0a51269","True","Int Health","China|Yunnan|Guangxi|Guangdong|Eighty-eight|55|nine|China","cc-by-nc","","PMC7017878","32040190","GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE","PMC","2020 Feb 10","","10.1093/inthealth/ihaa001","noncomm_use_subset"

A large number of medical staff was sent to Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public and 526 nurses (i.e., 234 front-line nurses and 292 non-front-line nurses) to evaluate vicarious traumatization scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Front-line nurses are engaged in the process of providing care for patients with COVID-19. The results showed that the vicarious traumatization scores for front-line nurses including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the vicarious traumatization scores of the general public were significantly higher than those of the front-line nurses (P < 0.001); however, no statistical difference was observed compared to the scores of non-front-line nurses (P > 0.05). Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the psychological problems of the medical staff, especially non-front-line nurses, and general public under the situation of the spread and control of COVID-19.

Mechanisms between HAP and pneumonia are poorly understood, but studies suggest that HAP may increase the likelihood of bacterial, instead of viral, pneumonia. We assessed the relationship between HAP and infant microbial nasal carriage among 260 infants participating in the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS). Methods Data are from GRAPHS, a cluster-randomized controlled trial of cookstove interventions (improved biomass or LPG) versus the 3-stone (baseline) cookstove. Infants were surveyed for pneumonia during the first year of life and had routine personal exposure assessments. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pneumonia cases (n = 130) and healthy controls (n = 130) were analyzed for presence of 22 common respiratory microbes by MassTag polymerase chain reaction. Data analyses included intention-to-treat (ITT) comparisons of microbial species presence by study arm, and exposure-response relationships. Results In ITT analyses, 3-stone arm participants had a higher mean number of microbial species than the LPG (LPG: 2.71, 3-stone: 3.34, p < 0.0001, n = 260). This difference was driven by increased bacterial (p < 0.0001) rather than viral species presence (non-significant). Results were pronounced in pneumonia cases and attenuated in healthy controls. Higher prevalence bacterial species were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Exposure-response relationships did not yield significant associations between measured CO and nasal microbial carriage. Conclusions Our intention-to-treat findings are consistent with a link between HAP and bacterial nasal carriage. No relationships were found for viral carriage. Given the null results in exposure-response analysis, it is likely that a pollutant besides CO is driving these differences.","cf3d012a747aadc8d8756951bd68985c0589f45b; 7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221","True","Environment International","Pneumonia|HAP|HAP|HAP|260|the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS)|Methods Data|GRAPHS|LPG|the first year|Nasopharyngeal|130|130|22|MassTag|3-stone|LPG|LPG|2.71|3-stone|3.34|0.0001|260|0.0001|Haemophilus|Streptococcus|Moraxella|CO|HAP|CO","els-covid","","PMC6868532","31518936","GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2019-12-31","","10.1016/j.envint.2019.105150","custom_license"

Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.

En Francia, por ejemplo, la incidencia es de un caso por cada 4.500 nacimientos. Esta enfermedad se debe a mutaciones en el gen CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, regulador de conductancia transmembrana de la fibrosis quística), situado en el brazo largo del cromosoma 7, que codifica una proteína transmembrana implicada en la regulación del transporte transepitelial de iones cloruro (Cl–). En Francia, la mutación más frecuente (alrededor del 80% de los casos) es la deleción del aminoácido 508 (fenilalanina), denominada F508del. La ausencia o la disfunción de la proteína CFTR provoca un defecto en el transporte de Cl– y un aumento de la reabsorción de sal y agua, en particular en el epitelio bronquial, lo que conlleva una reducción del líquido de la superficie bronquial. Esta exocrinopatía generalizada conduce a la producción de «moco viscoso» (de ahí el nombre de mucoviscidosis), que obstruye varios sitios en el cuerpo, en particular el sistema respiratorio, el tracto digestivo y sus anexos (páncreas, vías biliares e hígado). La detección neonatal se ha generalizado desde 2002. La prueba del sudor es la prueba complementaria de referencia, validada por la identificación de dos mutaciones patógenas, para la confirmación del diagnóstico. El tratamiento es multidisciplinario. Se basa ante todo en la kinesiterapia respiratoria diaria y el tratamiento de las sobreinfecciones broncopulmonares, así como en las recomendaciones nutricionales con el uso de extractos pancreáticos.

In this study, we generated four autologous recombinant viruses, including the highly virulent iPEDVPT-P5, attenuated iPEDVPT-P96, and two chimeric viruses (iPEDVPT-P5-96S and iPEDVPT-P96-5S) with the reciprocally exchanged spike (S) gene, to study the role of the S gene in PEDV pathogenesis. A deeper understanding of PEDV attenuation will aid in the rational design of a live attenuated vaccine (LAV) using reverse genetics system. Our results showed that replacing the S gene from the highly virulent iPEDVPT-P5 led to complete restoration of virulence of the attenuated iPEDVPT-P96, with nearly identical viral shedding, diarrhea pattern, and mortality rate as the parental iPEDVPT-P5. In contrast, substitution of the S gene with that from the attenuated iPEDVPT-P96 resulted in partial attenuation of iPEDVPT-P5, exhibiting similar viral shedding and diarrhea patterns as the parental iPEDVPT-P96 with slightly severe histological lesions and higher mortality rate. Collectively, our data confirmed that the attenuation of the PEDVPT-P96 virus is primarily attributed to mutations in the S gene. However, mutation in S gene alone could not fully attenuate the virulence of iPEDVPT-P5. Gene (s) other than S gene might also play a role in determining virulence.","4393d1b0e0262247c9c6ace6ebda9dcd5395d6fa","True","Viruses","PEDV|four|two|the S gene|LAV|S|PEDVPT|the S gene|Gene","cc-by","","PMC7019868","31905842","ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|ORG|PRODUCT|PERSON","PMC","2019 Dec 30","","10.3390/v12010041","comm_use_subset"

The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision-makers. Methods We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. Results We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples sequentially and reducing the time-scale for biological analysis, we were able to test the samples within 5 h (including sampling, shipment and biological tests).

A major virulence factor of P. gulae consists of a 41-kDa filamentous appendage (FimA) on the cell surface, which is classified into three genotypes: A, B, and C. Thus far, inhibition of periodontal disease in dogs remains difficult. The present study assessed the inhibitory effects of a combination of clindamycin and interferon alpha (IFN-α) formulation against P. gulae and periodontal disease. Growth of P. gulae was significantly inhibited by clindamycin; this inhibition had a greater effect on type C P. gulae than on type A and B isolates. In contrast, the IFN-α formulation inhibited the expression of IL-1β and COX-2 elicited by type A and B isolates, but not that elicited by type C isolates. Furthermore, periodontal recovery was promoted by the administration of both clindamycin and IFN-α formulation to dogs undergoing periodontal treatment; moreover, this combined treatment reduced the number of FimA genotypes in oral specimens from treated dogs. These results suggest that a combination of clindamycin and IFN-α formulation inhibit P. gulae virulence and thus may be effective for the prevention of periodontal disease induced by P. gulae.","fad068abaa998641db5de8113fced6b3ef3d613f","True","Sci Rep","41-kDa|three|C.|IFN-α|C P.|IFN-α|IL-1β|COX-2|IFN-α|FimA|IFN-α|P.","cc-by","","PMC7033253","32080231","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG|GPE|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 20","","10.1038/s41598-020-59730-9","comm_use_subset"

"Kruse, Robert L.","Therapeutic strategies in an outbreak scenario to treat the novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).","5a17ed3e4abf295f5820c65f56398266c1baae98; 489040d34aa5dc8e6eba3d4e9d3d48f0bcc6061f","True","F1000Res","2019-nCoV|Wuhan|China|2019-nCoV|today|2019-nCoV|Herein|2019-nCoV|RNA|2019-nCoV|enzyme 2|Fc|third|today|the coming months","cc-by","#1971","PMC7029759","32117569","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|DATE|DATE","PMC","2020 Feb 7","3004071935","10.12688/f1000research.22211.2","comm_use_subset"

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. Methods We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. Findings The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. Interpretation 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

"Zhu, Jiming; Ariana, Proochista","Provider perspectives on general practice in Henan, China: a mixed-methods study","OBJECTIVE: Since 2011 China’s central government has committed to establishing a new ‘general practitioner’ (GP)-centred primary care system. To this end there have been great efforts to train an additional 300 000 GPs by 2020. This paper examines the perspective of practitioners in Henan, China, regarding general practice. DESIGN: A mixed-methods approach using focus group discussions (FGD), and structured questionnaires. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Seven FGDs and responses to 1887 questionnaires included medical students, primary care doctors and GP residents in Henan. RESULTS: The three surveyed medical groups have some awareness of the attributes of general practice (eg, comprehensiveness, first contact and coordination), but often misinterpret what being a GP entails. Five themes were identified through the FGDs and tested quantitatively for their prevalence with structured questionnaires. First, the GPs’ role as a comprehensive care provider was (mis)interpreted as an ‘all-round doctor’. Second, the GP’s responsibility as the first point of care was understood in two conflicting ways: private personal doctors of the rich and the powerful or village doctors for common people. Third, referral was understood as simply guiding patients to appropriate departments within the hospital while the gatekeeping role was interpreted to involve GPs being peoples’ health protectors rather than being also gatekeepers of specialty services. Traditional Chinese medicine now further complicates the understanding of GPs. And lastly, the GPs’ main responsibility was considered to be public health work. CONCLUSION: The misunderstandings of the roles and responsibilities of GPs render problematic the policy foundation of China’s GP-centred primary care system. Pursuing the quantity of GPs on its own is meaningless, since the number needed depends on the delineated role of GPs. Top priority is to establish clarity about the GP role, which requires reforming the health delivery system to address issues with fragmented care, strategically taking into account the development of GPs with work delegation and substitution and providing more clarity on the distinction between general practice and public health.","9b1db58b45ac9db3de3c103db7e9de544c6c3eea; ff2461416a15e35f6befb112accdc1301f5a7724","True","BMJ Open","2011|China|an additional 300|2020|Henan|China|FGD|Seven|1887|GP|Henan|three|first|Five|First|GPs’|Second|GP|first|two|Third|Chinese|GPs’|China|GP","cc-by-nc","","PMC7044834","32019820","DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|GPE|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|NORP|ORG|GPE|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 3","","10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036240","noncomm_use_subset"

There is armed conflict in 12 of the region's 22 countries.1 , 2 The region's 680 million people3 represent 9% of the global population, yet the EMR is home to 43% of those who need humanitarian assistance4 and is the source of 64% of the world's refugees.5 The health effects of these crises are immense. Direct health consequences include trauma-related deaths and disability, gender-based violence, and mental disorders. Disruption of health systems contributes to increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, malnutrition, obstetric complications, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Health indicators in the EMR are among the worst in the world.6 State fragility and conflict are among the biggest challenges to attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 3.7 Conflict is a global health security threat because affected countries are less able to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks. More than 70% of disease outbreaks worldwide occur in fragile and conflict-affected settings.8 Yemen has experienced the largest cholera outbreak in history.9 During the second half of 2019, there were six concurrent disease outbreaks in Sudan.10 Wild polio virus returned to Syria due to conflict,11 while Afghanistan and Pakistan are two of three countries where the virus remains endemic.12 The average International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity score is much lower for the 12 conflict-affected countries than for the other countries in the region,6 placing them at greater risk of spread and public health consequences of the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other epidemic-prone diseases. WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners.

However, little information is available about the targets of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses. This includes SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in SARS-CoV-2 that have high homology to the SARS-CoV virus. Parallel bioinformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are promising targets for immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2. These predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this virus of high priority.","d202a1d1765204bdba9fa46aa07293a30e9d2188","True","Cell Host & Microbe","Summary Effective|2019|Analysis Resource|IEDB|CoV|Parallel|two","els-covid","#8785","","","ORG|DATE|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-16","","10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.002","custom_license"
"Jalava, Katri","First respiratory transmitted food borne outbreak?","Abstract The world is faced with a remarkable coronavirus outbreak with epicentre in Wuhan, China. Altogether 40554 cases have been confirmed globally with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) until February 10, 2020. Rigorous surveillance in other countries is required to prevent further global expansion of the outbreak, but resolving the exact mechanism of the initial transmission events is crucial. Most initial cases had visited Huanan South Seafood Market in Wuhan selling also various exotic live animals. Based on the limited initial human-to-human transmission and timely clustering of cases in Huanan market among elderly men, coupled with knowledge that coronaviruses are derived from animals and relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to bat coronavirus, zoonotic transmission in the first instance is probable. To target the actions, similar epidemiological actions to human cases are needed with animal or food exposures. According to current information, an exceptionally wide contamination of seafood market might explain the initiation of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Seafood tanks, air contamination by live animals or rodents are possibilities, but sold animals normally come from various sources. The mode of transmission may become clearer in future: usually in outbreak investigations, hindsight is easy, but for now information about the initial source of this outbreak is limited.","fdcd6d28e5d3836ebf047b6d2915611000d5615c","True","International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health","Wuhan|China|40554|February 10, 2020|Rigorous|Huanan South Seafood Market|Wuhan|Huanan|first","els-covid","#1832","","32088598","GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORDINAL","Elsevier","2020-05-31","2092729099","10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113490","custom_license"

Comparative metagenomic analysis of human and non-human primate (NHP) microbiomes offers a promising approach to study this symbiosis. Very few microbial species have been characterized in NHP microbiomes due to their poor representation in the available cataloged microbial diversity, thus limiting the potential of such comparative approaches. RESULTS: We reconstruct over 1000 previously uncharacterized microbial species from 6 available NHP metagenomic cohorts, resulting in an increase of the mappable fraction of metagenomic reads by 600%. These novel species highlight that almost 90% of the microbial diversity associated with NHPs has been overlooked. Comparative analysis of this new catalog of taxa with the collection of over 150,000 genomes from human metagenomes points at a limited species-level overlap, with only 20% of microbial candidate species in NHPs also found in the human microbiome. This overlap occurs mainly between NHPs and non-Westernized human populations and NHPs living in captivity, suggesting that host lifestyle plays a role comparable to host speciation in shaping the primate intestinal microbiome. Several NHP-specific species are phylogenetically related to human-associated microbes, such as Elusimicrobia and Treponema, and could be the consequence of host-dependent evolutionary trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: The newly reconstructed species greatly expand the microbial diversity associated with NHPs, thus enabling better interrogation of the primate microbiome and empowering in-depth human and non-human comparative and co-diversification studies.","e633cc8cbce07eacd478bb25aa824872ad55c59d","True","Genome Biol","NHP|NHP|over 1000|6|NHP|600%|almost 90%|over 150,000|only 20%|NHPs|NHPs|NHP|Elusimicrobia|Treponema","cc-by","","PMC6935492","31883524","ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 28","","10.1186/s13059-019-1923-9","comm_use_subset"

The syndrome has a multifactorial etiology and transport seems to favor pathogen proliferation. This study investigated the prevalence of different pathogens involved in BRD, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers collected before and after a long-distance journey. A total of 56 Limousine animals were included, travelling in three different shipments, on the same route from France to southern Italy in a semitrailer, on three different days from February to April. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNS)/steer were collected and tested by bimolecular analysis. Neither bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) nor bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) were detected. A higher prevalence of Histophilus somni was observed in the DNS collected during the third shipment in comparison with those registered during the first and the second one, probably due to a higher prevalence at departure. Conversely, the prevalence of bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis and Pasteurella multocida was higher on arrival in comparison with departure, confirming data reported in the literature. Overall, there were nasal microbiota changes in beef steers, with an increase in the prevalence of pathogens associated with BRD after travelling. ABSTRACT: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a serious health and economic problem in the beef industry, which is often associated with transportation and caused by different pathogens. The prevalence of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers before and after the same long-distance journey from France to southern Italy was documented. Fifty-six Limousine animals of three different shipments, travelling on three different days from February to April, were included. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two DNS/animal were collected and tested by Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Univariate logistic regression was carried out, considering time and day as fixed factors and the outcome of qPCR for each pathogen as a dependent categorical dichotomous variable (positive/negative, 1/0). The fact that the number of H. somni positive animals were found to be higher in the third shipment than the first and second one, indicating that this pathogen was already present before loading, is relevant. The prevalence of BCoV, BRSV, M. haemolytica, M. bovis, P. multocida was higher at T1 than T0, suggesting that other factors, such as stress and the epidemiological status of the arrival farm, played a role. The tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.","3ca853dca7e2037fb95acf0b90ce59c9776979b1","True","Animals (Basel)","Bovine|BRD|BRD|56|three|France|Italy|three|days|February|four days|two|1|BoHV-1|Histophilus|DNS|third|first|second|Mannheimia|Mycoplasma|Pasteurella|BRD|Bovine|BRD|1|BoHV-1|BVDV|BCoV|BRSV|BPiV|Pasteurella|Mannheimia|Histophilus|Mycoplasma|France|Italy|Fifty-six|Limousine|three|three|days|February|four days|two|DNS|Real Time|Univariate|1/0|H.|third|first|second|BCoV|BRSV|M.|P.|T1 than|BRD","cc-by","","PMC6940923","31817737","NORP|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 6","","10.3390/ani9121093","comm_use_subset"

To investigate the potential route of 2019-nCov infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, bulk RNA-seq profiles from two public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (FANTOM5 CAGE) dataset were collected.

"Wu, Joseph T; Leung, Kathy; Leung, Gabriel M","Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","Summary Background Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. Methods We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI). Findings In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304–130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks. Interpretation Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.

PA has the ability to alter host genome to facilitate its invasion, thus increasing the virulence of the organism. Sphingosine-1- phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid, is known to play a key role in facilitating infection. Sphingosine kinases (SPHK) 1&2 phosphorylate sphingosine to generate S1P in mammalian cells. We reported earlier that Sphk2(−/−) mice offered significant protection against lung inflammation, compared to wild type (WT) animals. Therefore, we profiled the differential expression of genes between the protected group of Sphk2(−/−) and the wild type controls to better understand the underlying protective mechanisms related to the Sphk2 deletion in lung inflammatory injury. Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on mouse lung tissue using NextSeq 500 sequencing system. RESULTS: Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis was performed and differentially expressed genes following PA infection were identified using whole transcriptome of Sphk2(−/−) mice and their WT counterparts. Pathway (PW) enrichment analyses of the RNA seq data identified several signaling pathways that are likely to play a crucial role in pneumonia caused by PA such as those involved in: 1. Immune response to PA infection and NF-κB signal transduction; 2. PKC signal transduction; 3. Impact on epigenetic regulation; 4. Epithelial sodium channel pathway; 5. Mucin expression; and 6. Bacterial infection related pathways. Our genomic data suggests a potential role for SPHK2 in PA-induced pneumonia through elevated expression of inflammatory genes in lung tissue. Further, validation by RT-PCR on 10 differentially expressed genes showed 100% concordance in terms of vectoral changes as well as significant fold change. CONCLUSION: Using Sphk2(−/−) mice and differential gene expression analysis, we have shown here that S1P/SPHK2 signaling could play a key role in promoting PA pneumonia. The identified genes promote inflammation and suppress others that naturally inhibit inflammation and host defense. Thus, targeting SPHK2/S1P signaling in PA-induced lung inflammation could serve as a potential therapy to combat PA-induced pneumonia.","52e083e335c8c29b8867ac67d5090b71348f2eac","True","BMC Genomics","PA|Gram|PA|Sphingosine-1-|1&2|S1P|RNA-Seq|NextSeq|500|Two|ANOVA|PA|WT|Pathway|RNA|PA|1|NF-κB|2|PKC|3|4|5|6|SPHK2|PA|RT-PCR|10|100%|S1P|SPHK2|PA|SPHK2/S1P|PA|PA","cc-by","","PMC6916461","31842752","ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|FAC|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 16","","10.1186/s12864-019-6367-9","comm_use_subset"

The authors also indicated that scientifically, SARS-CoV-2 is naturally occurring and different from other SARS-like or SARS-related coronaviruses that are mainly characterised by their genome sequences. Furthermore, given the probability of future attenuation of this virus to a low-pathogenic form, the authors predict that the use of the name SARS-CoV-2 might have adverse effects, both socially and economically. On these grounds, the authors suggest that the name of the new virus is changed to human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19). Although these concerns and suggestions are appreciated, we feel that the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group was appropriate. To facilitate good practice and scientific exchange, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has established standardised formats for classifying viruses. Under these rules, a newly emerged virus is normally assigned to a species based on phylogeny and taxonomy.4 Through DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering-based analyses,5 the newly emerged coronavirus was deemed not sufficiently novel but is a sister virus to SARS-CoV, the primary viral isolate defining the species. The SARS-CoV species includes viruses such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV_PC4-227, and SARSr-CoV-btKY72. SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of this viral species. The use of SARS in naming SARS-CoV-2 does not derive from the name of the SARS disease but is a natural extension of the taxonomic practice for viruses in the SARS species. The use of SARS for viruses in this species mainly refers to their taxonomic relationship to the founding virus of this species, SARS-CoV. In other words, viruses in this species can be named SARS regardless of whether or not they cause SARS-like diseases.","6dde340deadeeaaef0533b4e5f15f8deff71510a","True","The Lancet","the Correspondence by Shibo Jiang|colleagues,1|2|the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy|WHO|2019|2019|the Coronavirus Study Group|the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|Clustering|SARSr-CoV-btKY72","els-covid","#5425","","","ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|QUANTITY","Elsevier","2020-03-06","2047323912","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30557-2","custom_license"

Objective We present some remarkable imaging findings of the first two patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included, showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Results Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up, apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration. Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with short-axis oval nodes. Conclusions Although only two patients have been studied, these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in literature. Finally, the pulmonary vessels enlargement in areas where new lung infiltrates develop in the follow-up CT scan, could describe an early predictor radiological sign of lung impairment.","71c14c4b2d5b2a765f43ce1dfbfbfaa80d18c409","True","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","2019|Coronavirus|first|two|Italy|Wuhan|China|X-Rays|CT|ARDS|only two|CT","els-covid","#2446","","","DATE|PERSON|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-04-30","2087800735","10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.043","custom_license"

Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) has been employed to identify uncommon and novel infectious etiologies and characterize virus diversity in human, animal, and environmental samples. Here, we systematically reviewed studies that performed viral mNGS in common livestock (cattle, small ruminants, poultry, and pigs). We identified 2481 records and 120 records were ultimately included after a first and second screening. Pigs were the most frequently studied livestock and the virus diversity found in samples from poultry was the highest. Known animal viruses, zoonotic viruses, and novel viruses were reported in available literature, demonstrating the capacity of mNGS to identify both known and novel viruses. However, the coverage of metagenomic studies was patchy, with few data on the virome of small ruminants and respiratory virome of studied livestock. Essential metadata such as age of livestock and farm types were rarely mentioned in available literature, and only 10.8% of the datasets were publicly available. Developing a deeper understanding of livestock virome is crucial for detection of potential zoonotic and animal pathogens and One Health preparedness.

"Qing, Enya; Hantak, Michael; Perlman, Stanley; Gallagher, Tom","Distinct Roles for Sialoside and Protein Receptors in Coronavirus Infection","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are common human and animal pathogens that can transmit zoonotically and cause severe respiratory disease syndromes. CoV infection requires spike proteins, which bind viruses to host cell receptors and catalyze virus-cell membrane fusion. Several CoV strains have spike proteins with two receptor-binding domains, an S1A that engages host sialic acids and an S1B that recognizes host transmembrane proteins. As this bivalent binding may enable broad zoonotic CoV infection, we aimed to identify roles for each receptor in distinct infection stages. Focusing on two betacoronaviruses, murine JHM-CoV and human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we found that virus particle binding to cells was mediated by sialic acids; however, the transmembrane protein receptors were required for a subsequent virus infection. These results favored a two-step process in which viruses first adhere to sialic acids and then require subsequent engagement with protein receptors during infectious cell entry. However, sialic acids sufficiently facilitated the later stages of virus spread through cell-cell membrane fusion, without requiring protein receptors. This virus spread in the absence of the prototype protein receptors was increased by adaptive S1A mutations. Overall, these findings reveal roles for sialic acids in virus-cell binding, viral spike protein-directed cell-cell fusion, and resultant spread of CoV infections.","e9239100c5493ea914dc23c3d7a262f4326022ac; 3fa90782b0cd99871663f5317bb69d255cfde50f","True","mBio","CoV|CoV|two|S1B|CoV|two|JHM|CoV|Middle East|two|first|S1A|CoV","cc-by","#2427","PMC7018658","32047128","PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|LOC|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|NORP|LAW","PMC","2020 Feb 11","3005811007","10.1128/mBio.02764-19","comm_use_subset"

As part of these social distancing policies, the Chinese Government encouraged people to stay at home; discouraged mass gatherings; cancelled or postponed large public events; and closed schools, universities, government offices, libraries, museums, and factories. Only limited segments of urban public transport systems remained operational and all cross-province bus routes were taken out of service. As a result of these policies and public information and education campaigns, Chinese citizens started to take measures to protect themselves against COVID-19, such as staying at home as far as possible, limiting social contacts, and wearing protective masks when they needed to move in public.","a7676f3befa0ef28c3ad4e411a46f631f5623da8","True","The Lancet","the Chinese Lunar New Year|COVID-19|the Chinese Government|Chinese|COVID-19","els-covid","#2005","","32105609","EVENT|PERSON|ORG|NORP|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-13","1220324463","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30421-9","custom_license"

Some viruses subvert LN B cell activation; however, our knowledge of viral hindrance of B cell responses of important human pathogens is lacking. Here, we define mechanisms whereby chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted RNA virus that causes outbreaks of acute and chronic arthritis in humans, hinders dLN antiviral B cell responses. Infection of WT mice with pathogenic, but not acutely cleared CHIKV, induced MyD88-dependent recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils to the dLN. Blocking this influx improved lymphocyte accumulation, dLN organization, and CHIKV-specific B cell responses. Both inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (Nox2) contributed to impaired dLN organization and function. Infiltrating monocytes expressed iNOS through a local IRF5- and IFNAR1-dependent pathway that was partially TLR7-dependent. Together, our data suggest that pathogenic CHIKV triggers the influx and activation of monocytes and neutrophils in the dLN that impairs virus-specific B cell responses.","069bf4da8f0f4f540b9f6a16021e007442e7e027; 53da3d32d1193129d3366af8aee4bc9a4224aa46","True","PLoS Pathog","LN B|CHIKV|RNA|CHIKV|CHIKV|IFNAR1-dependent pathway|CHIKV","cc0","","PMC7012455","31999809","PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 30","","10.1371/journal.ppat.1008292","comm_use_subset"

"Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola","New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines’ availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a medicine shortage. Only in 2019, the EMA and HMA joint task force released the first harmonized “shortage” definition in the European Economic Area (EEA) and guidance on public communication. This manuscript aims to review the current European regulatory framework on medicine shortages. To support the activities of regulators, manufacturers and other healthcare professionals, an algorithm was also proposed to be used as a harmonized procedure to determine the shortage/unavailability impact on public health and to rationalize the problem-solving strategies adopted in all different settings.","63495fd69b9b1e72e551e992d16552853cb5aee0","True","International Journal of Pharmaceutics","Abstract Medicine|European|National Healthcare Systems|European Regulatory Authorities|years|European|2019|EMA|HMA|first|the European Economic Area|EEA|European","els-covid","#3143","","32092455","ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG|DATE|NORP|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|LOC|ORG|NORP","Elsevier","2020-04-15","2942764320","10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171","custom_license"

The two patients shared common clinical features including fever, cough, and multiple ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung field with patchy infiltration. Here, we highlight the use of a low-input metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach on RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF).

As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24–3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.","a006cb9a90f0625f548c5775891d395860c81c75","True","International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents","2|2019|2019-nCoV|China|the end of 2019|11 February 2020|the World Health Organization|more than 43|28|99%|China|30 January 2020|WHO|COVID-19|sixth|two|SL-CoVZC45|SL|6.4 days|2.24–3.58|Wuhan|one|USA|China","els-covid","#1132","","32081636","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-31","3006645647","10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105924","custom_license"

By February 14, 2020, a total of 66,576 confirmed cases of COVID-19, people infected with SARS-CoV-2, were reported in China, leading to 1,524 deaths, per the Chinese CDC (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/). Several full genomic sequences of this virus have been released for the study of its evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics2, 3, 4. Here, we analyzed the potential mutations that may have evolved after the virus became epidemic among humans and also the mutations resulting in the human adaptation. The sequences of BetaCoV were downloaded on February 3, 2020 from the GISAID platform5. A total of 58 accessions were available, among which BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 is a known close relative of SARS-CoV-2. Four accessions, namely, BetaCov/Italy/INM1/2020, BetaCov/Italy/INM2/2020, BetaCoV/Kanagawa/1/2020, and BetaCoV/USA/IL1/2020, were excluded because of the short-truncated sequences or multiple ambiguous nucleotides. A total of 54 accessions (Supplementary table 1) isolated from humans were utilized in the following analysis. The sequences NC_004718.3 of SARS coronavirus6 genes were utilized to define the protein products of SARS-CoV-2. The protein sequences of ORF1ab, S, E, M, and N genes were translated, and all of the loci without experimental evidences were excluded. First, the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were compared with RaTG13, human SARS (NC_004718.3), bat SARS (DQ022305.2), and human MERS (NC_019843.3) by calculating the similarity in a given sliding window (Figure 1A).

This is the second most deadly EVD outbreak in history, after the one that occurred in West Africa in 2014. The DRC Ministry of Health (MoH), supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a range of regional and international partners, are implementing EVD response plans in these affected areas such as screening of suspect cases at points of entry, case detection, contact tracing, laboratory testing, case management and infection prevention and control, safe and dignified burials, ring vaccination (this involves vaccination of infected individuals, direct contacts of infected individuals and contacts of their contacts), and therapeutics, community mobilization and free access to healthcare services. Despite these efforts, there has been a sharp rise in the number of confirmed cases within the identified affected areas, and due to a number of challenges unique to DRC, there has been an expansion in the geographical extent of transmission. The significance of the proximity of these regions to wildlife and the Virunga National Park is questionable in the EVD transmission dynamics.

Materials and methods We retrospectively examined 44 confirmed COVID-19 cases. All cases were evaluated separately by radiologists (visually) and through an in-house computer software. The degree of lesions was visually scored by the radiologist, as follows, for each of the 5 lung lobes: 0, no lesion present; 1, <1/3 involvement; 2, >1/3 and < 2/3 involvement; and 3, >2/3 involvement. Lesion density was assessed based on the proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and fibrosis of the lesions. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included lung volume (mL), lesion volume (mL), lesion percentage (%), and mean lesion density (HU) of the whole lung, right lung, left lung, and each lobe. The scores obtained by the radiologists and quantitative results generated by the computer software were tested for correlation. A Chi-square test was used to test the consistency of radiologist- and computer-derived lesion percentage in the right/left lung, upper/lower lobe, and each of the 5 lobes. Result The results showed a strong to moderate correlation between lesion percentage scores obtained by radiologists and the computer software (r ranged from 0.7679 to 0.8373, P < 0.05), and a moderate correlation between the proportion of GGO and mean lesion density (r = −0.5894, P < 0.05), and proportion of consolidation and mean lesion density (r = 0.6282, P < 0.05). Computer-aided quantification showed a statistical significant higher lesion percentage for lower lobes than that assessed by the radiologists (χ2 = 8.160, P = 0.004). Conclusions Our experiments demonstrated that the computer tool could reliably and accurately assess the severity and distribution of pneumonia on CT scans.","2a96b22eaced1cd79d80008617daa3ac86dcdc84","True","Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis","Coronavirus Disease 2019|COVID-19|CT|44|5|0|1|1/3|2|1/3|2/3|3|2/3|GGO|mL|mL|HU|Chi|5|0.7679|0.8373|0.05|GGO|0.05|0.6282|0.05|8.160|CT","els-covid","#4449","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-06","2970191042","10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.004","custom_license"
"Sharma, Bal Krishan; Kakker, Naresh Kumar; Bhadouriya, Sakshi; Chhabra, Rajesh","Effect of TLR agonist on infections bronchitis virus replication and cytokine expression in embryonated chicken eggs","Abstract Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, highly infectious and contagious viral disease of chickens caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belonging to the genus Coronavirus and family Coronaviridae. It can affect all age groups of birds. The toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major class of innate immune pattern recognition receptors that have a key role in immune response and defense against various infections.The TLRs are essential for initiation of innate immune responses and in the development of adaptive immune responses. An in ovo model was employed to study the antiviral activity of TLR ligands (Pam3CSK4, LPS and CpG ODN) on replication of IBV. It was hypothesized that optimum dose and specific timing of TLR ligands may reduce viral load of IBV in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs). Further, the mechanism involved in the TLR-mediated antiviral response in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of ECEs was investigated. The ECEs of 9–11 days old were treated with different doses (high, intermediate and low) of TLR-2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR-4 (LPS) and TLR-21 (CpG ODN) ligands. In addition, to know the timing of TLR ligand treatment, six time intervals were analyzed viz. 36, 24 and 12 h prior to infection, time of infection (co-administration of TLR ligands and avian IBV) and 12 and 24 h post-IBV infection. For studying the relative expression of immuno-stimulatory genes (IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-1β, iNOS and OAS) in CAM, TLR ligands were administered through intra-allantoicroute and CAM were collected at 4, 8 and 16 h post treatment. The results demonstrated that intermediate dose of all the three TLR ligands significantly reduced virus titers and used in the present study. However, the LPS reduced virus titer pre- and post-IBV infection but Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN reduced only pre-IBV infection. Further analysis showed that TLR ligands induced IFN-γ, IL-1β and IFN stimulated genes viz. iNOS and OAS genes in CAM. The present study pointed towards the novel opportunities for rational design of LPS as immuno-stimulatory agent in chickens with reference to IBV. It may be speculated that in ovo administration of these TLR ligands may enhance resistance against viral infection in neonatal chicken and may contribute towards the development of more effective and safer vaccines including in ovo vaccines.","57190cc7bf5031d27e19debe1aa16ddf4893f033","True","Molecular Immunology","Avian|IB|IBV|Coronavirus|Coronaviridae|TLR|Pam3CSK4|LPS|CpG ODN|IBV|TLR|IBV|SPF|TLR|CAM|9–11 days old|TLR-2|TLR-4|LPS|TLR-21|TLR|six|36|24|12|TLR|IBV|12|24|IFN-α|IFN-β|IFN-γ|OAS|CAM|TLR|CAM|4|8|16|three|TLR|LPS|CpG ODN|TLR|IFN-γ|IFN|OAS|CAM|LPS|IBV|TLR","els-covid","#2404","","","ORG|GPE|ORG|PERSON|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-04-30","3006185830","10.1016/j.molimm.2020.02.001","custom_license"
"Fang, Lei; Karakiulakis, George; Roth, Michael","Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?","The most distinctive comorbidities of 32 non-survivors from a group of 52 intensive care unit patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the study by Xiaobo Yang and colleagues1 were cerebrovascular diseases (22%) and diabetes (22%). Another study2 included 1099 patients with confirmed COVID-19, of whom 173 had severe disease with comorbidities of hypertension (23·7%), diabetes mellitus (16·2%), coronary heart diseases (5·8%), and cerebrovascular disease (2·3%). In a third study,3 of 140 patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 30% had hypertension and 12% had diabetes. Notably, the most frequent comorbidities reported in these three studies of patients with COVID-19 are often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; however, treatment was not assessed in either study. Human pathogenic coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] and SARS-CoV-2) bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels.4 The expression of ACE2 is substantially increased in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who are treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs).4 Hypertension is also treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which results in an upregulation of ACE2.5 ACE2 can also be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen. These data suggest that ACE2 expression is increased in diabetes and treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs increases ACE2 expression. Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. We therefore hypothesise that diabetes and hypertension treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19. • View related content for this article If this hypothesis were to be confirmed, it could lead to a conflict regarding treatment because ACE2 reduces inflammation and has been suggested as a potential new therapy for inflammatory lung diseases, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. A further aspect that should be investigated is the genetic predisposition for an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be due to ACE2 polymorphisms that have been linked to diabetes mellitus, cerebral stroke, and hypertension, specifically in Asian populations. Summarising this information, the sensitivity of an individual might result from a combination of both therapy and ACE2 polymorphism. We suggest that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension, or diabetes, who are treated with ACE2-increasing drugs, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection and, therefore, should be monitored for ACE2-modulating medications, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Based on a PubMed search on Feb 28, 2020, we did not find any evidence to suggest that antihypertensive calcium channel blockers increased ACE2 expression or activity, therefore these could be a suitable alternative treatment in these patients.","1aa561958019a5c680cdd4a6a6e5d063f3ed1831","True","The Lancet Respiratory Medicine","32|52|2019|COVID-19|Xiaobo Yang|22%|22%|1099|COVID-19|173|23·7%|16·2%|5·8%|2·3%|third|study,3|140|COVID-19|30%|12%|three|ACE|CoV|1|2|ACE|ARBs).4 Hypertension|ACE|ACE2.5|ACE|COVID-19|COVID-19|View|Asian|ACE|PubMed|Feb 28, 2020","els-covid","#7337","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|NORP|PERSON|GPE|DATE","Elsevier","2020-03-11","","10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30116-8","custom_license"

In this present study, we developed a detection system of microbes from porcine respiratory by using TaqMan real-time PCR (referred to as Dempo-PCR) to screen a broad range of pathogens associated with porcine respiratory diseases in a single run. We selected 17 porcine respiratory pathogens (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Boldetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella multocida toxin, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Mycoplasma hyosynovie, porcine circovirus 2, pseudorabies virus, porcine cytomegalovirus, swine influenza A virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, EU strain, porcine respiratory coronavirus and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) as detection targets and designed novel specific primer-probe sets for seven of them. In sensitivity test by using standard curves from synthesized DNA, all primer-probe sets showed high sensitivity. However, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus is known to have a high frequency of genetic mutations, and the primer and probe sequences will need to be checked at a considerable frequency when performing Dempo-PCR from field samples. A total of 30 lung samples from swine showing respiratory symptoms on six farms were tested by the Dempo-PCR to validate the assay’s clinical performance. As the results, 12 pathogens (5 virus and 7 bacteria) were detected and porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Haemophilus parasuis, and porcine cytomegalovirus were detected at high frequency. These results suggest that Dempo-PCR assay can be applied as a screening system with wide detection targets.","2c2f0107d55f1c770896c982d59e0bfa035fd4d7","True","J Vet Med Sci","Porcine|TaqMan|Dempo|17|Boldetella|Haemophilus|Pasteurella|Pasteurella|Streptococcus|Mycoplasma|Mycoplasma|Mycoplasma|2|US|EU|seven|Dempo|30|six|Dempo|12|5|7|US|Mycoplasma|Haemophilus|Dempo","cc-by-nc-nd","","PMC7041981","31866601","ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 23","","10.1292/jvms.19-0063","noncomm_use_subset"

It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral–fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology.

Despite extensive traditional and molecular epidemiological studies, factors associated with the spread of HPAI among midwestern poultry premises remain unclear. To better understand the dynamics of this outbreak, 182 full genome HPAI H5N2 sequences isolated from commercial layer chicken and turkey production premises were analyzed using evolutionary models able to accommodate epidemiological and geographic information. Epidemiological compartmental models embedded in a phylogenetic framework provided evidence that poultry type acted as a barrier to the transmission of virus among midwestern poultry farms. Furthermore, after initial introduction, the propagation of HPAI cases was self-sustainable within the commercial poultry industries. Discrete trait diffusion models indicated that within state viral transitions occurred more frequently than inter-state transitions. Distance and sample size were very strongly supported as associated with viral transition between county groups (Bayes Factor > 30.0). Together these findings indicate that the different types of midwestern poultry industries were not a single homogenous population, but rather, the outbreak was shaped by poultry industries and geographic factors.","4363936c1edadc4d1a30103f0dba198354b16051","True","PLoS Pathog","2014–2015|HPAI|H5NX|HPAI|the United States|HPAI|182|HPAI|HPAI|Bayes Factor|30.0","cc0","","PMC7004387","31961906","CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","PMC","2020 Jan 21","","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007857","comm_use_subset"

"Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Chiew, Calvin J; Lee, Vernon J","Can we contain the COVID-19 outbreak with the same measures as for SARS?","Summary The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 resulted in more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths. SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths. Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.","2f8a485f1acf987c6fe46621216f436b0e351af6","True","The Lancet Infectious Diseases","2003|more than 8000|800|Feb 28, 2020|2 months|2019|COVID-19|more than 82|COVID-19|more than 2800|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19","els-covid","#4409","","","DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-05","3006642361","10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30129-8","custom_license"

The modelling study by Marius Gilbert and colleagues in The Lancet identifies each African country's risk of importation of COVID-19 from China, using data on the volume of air travel from three airports in provinces in China to African countries. Gilbert and colleagues use two indicators to determine the capacity of countries to detect and respond to cases: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Based on their analysis, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa had the highest importation risk, and a moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya had moderate risk with variable capacity and high vulnerability. In the model, the risk mainly originates from Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. Methods We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020. Findings We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (R t) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of R t, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.

Public activities are discouraged. The Ministry of Education estimates that more than 220 million children and adolescents are confined to their homes; this includes 180 million primary and secondary students and 47 million preschool children).1 Thanks to the strong administrative system in China, the emergency home schooling plan has been rigorously implemented.2 Massive efforts are being made by schools and teachers at all levels to create online courses and deliver them through TV broadcasts and the internet in record time. The new virtual semester has just started in many parts of the country, and various courses are offered online in a well organised manner. These actions are helping to alleviate many parents' concerns about their children's educational attainment by ensuring that school learning is largely undisrupted. Although these measures and efforts are highly commendable and necessary, there are reasons to be concerned because prolonged school closure and home confinement during a disease outbreak might have negative effects on children's physical and mental health.3 , 4 Evidence suggests that when children are out of school (eg, weekends and summer holidays), they are physically less active, have much longer screen time, irregular sleep patterns, and less favourable diets, resulting in weight gain and a loss of cardiorespiratory fitness.3 , 5 Such negative effects on health are likely to be much worse when children are confined to their homes without outdoor activities and interaction with same aged friends during the outbreak.","e986a38beb5e5ed8fd7e370bd3c3262789c69c74","True","The Lancet","2019|COVID-19|the Chinese Government|The Ministry of Education|more than 220 million|180 million|47 million|China|4 Evidence|5","els-covid","#4165","","","DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-04","1968779433","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30547-X","custom_license"
"Mbareche, Hamza; Veillette, Marc; Bilodeau, Guillaume; Duchaine, Caroline","Comparison of the performance of ITS1 and ITS2 as barcodes in amplicon-based sequencing of bioaerosols","This paper presents the performance of two eukaryotic genomic ribosomal regions, ITS1 and ITS2, in describing fungal diversity in aerosol samples using amplicon-based High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS). Composting sites, biomethanization facilities, and dairy farms, all affected by the presence of fungi, were visited to collect air samples. The amplicon-based HTS approach is a target enrichment method that relies on the amplification of a specific target using particular primers before sequencing. Thus, the results are highly dependent on the quality of amplification. For this reason, the authors of this paper used a shotgun metagenomic approach to compare its outcome with the amplicon-based method. Indeed, shotgun metagenomic does not rely on any amplification prior to sequencing, because all genes are sequenced without a specific target. In addition, culture methods were added to the analyses in biomethanization and dairy farms samples to validate their contribution to fungal diversity of aerosols. The results obtained are unequivocal towards ITS1 outperformance to ITS2 in terms of richness, and taxonomic coverage. The differential abundance analysis did demonstrate that some taxa were exclusively detected only by ITS2, and vice-versa for ITS1. However, the shotgun metagenomic approach showed a taxonomic profile more resembling to ITS1 than ITS2. Based on these results, neither of the barcodes evaluated is perfect in terms of distinguishing all species. Using both barcodes offers a broader view of the fungal aerosol population. However, with the actual knowledge, the authors strongly recommend using ITS1 as a universal fungal barcode for quick general analyses of diversity and when limited financial resources are available, primarily due its ability to capture taxonomic profiles similar to those obtained using the shotgun metagenomic. The culture comparison with amplicon-based sequencing showed the complementarity of both approaches in describing the most abundant taxa.","9bfc043d8a0d90892e9183f75dbe141a30fd68b8","True","PeerJ","two|High-Throughput Sequencing|HTS|HTS|ITS1","cc-by","","PMC7032056","32110484","CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|WORK_OF_ART|FAC","PMC","2020 Feb 17","","10.7717/peerj.8523","comm_use_subset"

A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent and was subsequently termed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Considered a relative of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 is caused by a betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 that affects the lower respiratory tract and manifests as pneumonia in humans. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with 90,870 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 3,000 deaths worldwide.

Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.","5307fbd7cbc9b0b7e87ec4d1a8b99e544d81446f","True","Journal of Autoimmunity","Coronavirus|Wuhan City|China|COVID-19|COVID-19|COVID-19","els-covid","#2415","","","PERSON|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-26","3006645647","10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102433","custom_license"

"McBryde, Emma","The value of early transmission dynamic studies in emerging infectious diseases","The world is braced for a public health emergency of international concern caused by a novel emerging infectious disease, a coronavirus with similarities to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China and has spread to become a global pandemic, with, as of Feb 26, 2020, community transmission in Italy, Iran, and South Korea. Modelling studies have aided understanding of COVID-19 dynamics from the first announcement of the epidemic and publication of the genetic sequence of the causative virus. Initial phylogenetic analysis of closely related viruses suggested highly linked person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 originating from mid-November to early December, 2019.1, 2 Following this, modellers provided simple calculations that identified a mismatch between reported cases in China and reported importations of cases from travellers. Based on travel volumes, modellers inferred3 that cases in Wuhan were underestimated by a factor of 40—a crucially important finding. Further calculations, again based on travel volumes, suggested that some countries would be expected to have many more travel-related cases than had been notified,4 drawing attention to the possibility of undetected cases and community transmission in several countries. • View related content for this article Transmission dynamic models are a necessary first step in understanding the pandemic potential of an emerging infectious disease, including estimating the reproduction number—the number of new cases arising from a typical infected case. The first published transmission dynamic study of COVID-19 was rapid and uncomplicated, estimating the basic reproduction number as time-invariant5 without exploring some of the major underlying assumptions, such as lack of infectiousness during the incubation period. Since this early publication, many estimates for the reproduction rate have appeared, ranging from around 2 to more than 6.6","4477e8b7702147bc75ab4ef409eff8363186d319","True","The Lancet Infectious Diseases","CoV|2019|COVID-19|December|2019|Wuhan|China|Feb 26, 2020|Italy|Iran|South Korea|Modelling|COVID-19|first|mid-November to early December|2019.1|2|China|Wuhan|View|Transmission|first|first|COVID-19|around 2|more than 6.6","els-covid","#6995","","","PERSON|DATE|ORG|DATE|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|LAW|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-11","","10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30161-4","custom_license"

In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested. Findings Patient 1—a woman in her 60s—returned from China in mid-January, 2020.

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. Methods All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. Findings By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα. Interpretation The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.

"Zhu, Huaping; Wang, Lin; Fang, Chengzhi; Peng, Sicong; Zhang, Lianhong; Chang, Guiping; Xia, Shiwen; Zhou, Wenhao","Clinical analysis of 10 neonates born to mothers with 2019-nCoV pneumonia","BACKGROUND: The newly identified 2019-nCoV, which appears to have originated in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in central China, is spreading rapidly nationwide. A number of cases of neonates born to mothers with 2019-nCoV pneumonia have been recorded. However, the clinical features of these cases have not been reported, and there is no sufficient evidence for the proper prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infections in neonates. METHODS: The clinical features and outcomes of 10 neonates (including 2 twins) born to 9 mothers with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in 5 hospitals from January 20 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Among these 9 pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, onset of clinical symptoms occurred before delivery in 4 cases, on the day of delivery in 2 cases, and after delivery in 3 cases. In most cases, fever and a cough were the first symptoms experienced, and 1 patient also had diarrhea. Of the newborns born to these mothers, 8 were male and 2 were female; 4 were full-term infants and 6 were born premature; 2 were small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and 1 was a large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infant; there were 8 singletons and 2 twins. Of the neonates, 6 had a Pediatric Critical Illness Score (PCIS) score of less than 90. Clinically, the first symptom in the neonates was shortness of breath (n=6), but other initial symptoms such as fever (n=2), thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function (n=2), rapid heart rate (n=1), vomiting (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=1) were observed. Up to now, 5 neonates have been cured and discharged, 1 has died, and 4 neonates remain in hospital in a stable condition.

"Kampf, G.; Todt, D.; Pfaender, S.; Steinmann, E.","Persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces and their inactivation with biocidal agents","Summary Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.","f95dff44aae700378dd3746ea194c9a31a7b15b8","True","Journal of Hospital Infection","Summary|between 2-10 days|22|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|Middle East Respiratory Syndrome|HCoV|up to 9 days|62–71%|0.5%|0.1%|1 minute|0.05–0.2%|0.02%","els-covid","#3162","","32035997","GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|TIME|PERCENT|PERCENT","Elsevier","2020-03-31","3005057892","10.1016/j.jhin.2020.01.022","custom_license"

As a result, sequence similarity of paralogous genes is significantly higher than expected from their evolutionary distance. Gene conversion, a “copy paste” DNA repair mechanism that transfers sequences from one gene to another and homologous recombination are drivers of concerted evolution. Nevertheless, some gene family members escape concerted evolution and acquire sufficient sequence differences that orthologous genes can be assigned in descendant species. Reasons why some gene family members can escape while others are captured by concerted evolution are poorly understood. By analyzing the entire CEA gene family in cattle (Bos taurus) we identified a member (CEACAM32) that was created by gene duplication and cooption of a unique transmembrane domain exon in the most recent ancestor of ruminants. CEACAM32 shows a unique, testis-specific expression pattern. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CEACAM32 is not involved in concerted evolution of CEACAM1 paralogs in ruminants. However, analysis of gene conversion events revealed that CEACAM32 is subject to gene conversion but remarkably, these events are found in the leader exon and intron sequences but not in exons coding for the Ig-like domains. These findings suggest that natural selection hinders gene conversion affecting protein sequences of the mature protein and thereby support escape of CEACAM32 from concerted evolution.","2e45e30b65fd34a5727e967dda22436bffc2b57e","True","Sci Rep","CEA|one|CEA|CEACAM1|Ig","cc-by","","PMC7042247","32099040","ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|PERSON","PMC","2020 Feb 25","","10.1038/s41598-020-60425-4","comm_use_subset"

Methods We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. Findings As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3–6). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days. Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions.

The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well.

It is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. We identified factors associated with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) infection among suspected cases presented with sign and symptoms of upper respiratory infection or exposure to the virus. We also looked at the impact of medication history on virus transmission. METHOD: We included subjects with suspected MERS-CoV infection and confirmed cases of MERS infection. Subjects were excluded if there were any missing data that prevent the final analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to report demographic data. Percentages and frequencies were used to summarize the categorical variables, while means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables. Logistic regression was used to assess the risk of MERS-CoV infection among the suspected cases. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 16,189 suspected cases were identified, complete data were analyzed for 3154 to assess factors that are independently associated with MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection was associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.06; 95% CI [1.02–1.098], P-value = 0.004), male gender (AOR = 1.617; 95% CI [1.365–1.77], P-value < 0.001) and diabetes (AOR = 1.68; 95% CI [1.346–1.848], P-value = 0.002. There was no significant association with the other comorbidities. Medication history was not associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: MERS-Cov infection is more common in male, advanced age and diabetes. No medications were associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection. This is important to focus on screening and detection to this patient population.","aa27ee27248b8daab7e85d3fd1044383876b099a; c23db0f0dc55dea350cd7e27939acad930c6c85a","True","Saudi Pharm J","2012|Saudi Arabia|the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus|MERS‐CoV|METHOD|CoV|Percentages|CoV|0.05|16,189|3154|CoV|CoV|1.06|95%|CI|1.617|95%|CI|0.001|1.68|95%|CI|1.346–1.848|0.002|Medication|Cov","cc-by-nc-nd","","PMC7000305","32042254","DATE|GPE|LOC|GPE|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON","PMC","2020 Feb 7","","10.1016/j.jsps.2019.11.016","noncomm_use_subset"

It is generally accepted that membrane fusion occurs when the vesicle and target membranes are brought into close proximity by SNAREs and SM proteins. In this work, we demonstrate that, for fusion to occur, membrane bilayers must be destabilized by a conserved membrane-embedded motif located at the juxtamembrane region of the vesicle-anchored v-SNARE. Comprised of basic and hydrophobic residues, the juxtamembrane motif perturbs the lipid bilayer structure and promotes SNARE-SM-mediated membrane fusion. The juxtamembrane motif can be functionally substituted with an unrelated membrane-disrupting peptide in the membrane fusion reaction. These findings establish the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE as a membrane-destabilizing peptide.

"Froes, F.","And now for something completely different: from 2019-nCoV and COVID-19 to 2020-nMan","Infectious diseases have accompanied mankind since the beginning of humanity and have had a profound impact on the history and development of humanity and civilisation. This is natural if we are aware that microorganisms represent the majority of the biomass on planet Earth, and that there are more microorganisms, specifically bacteria, in the human body than there are cells. To be more precise, about 1012 human cells for every 1013 bacteria, as an adaptive advantage of the replication of bacteria that occurs every 20–40 min, as against tens of years in the human species. Infectious diseases, in particular pandemics and local epidemics, have influenced the course of wars, all descendants, including those of rulers, and the fate of peoples and nations.1 By way of example, we should remember the importance of malaria in the fall of the Roman Empire, the Black Death in the 14th century which killed nearly a third of the world’s population, and the impact of the “Spanish” flu pandemic of 1918–19 in Portugal, which in a few months decimated 1% of the Portuguese population and reduced average life expectancy to 20 years and, more recently, smallpox, declared eradicated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1980 as a result of vaccination,2 and with an estimated mortality in the 20th century of between 300 and 500 million people.3 In light of this impact, it is legitimate to consider infections one of the main modellers of mankind and of present and future generations, as well as generations of the descendants of survivors. We have also been major challengers of infectious diseases in the 21st century. Most notably in 2009 and 2010, when the 2009 influenza pandemic caused by the A (H1N1) subtype strain occurred, which originated in Mexico, with a virulence rate of 5–10% of the world’s population, and an estimated mortality of 300,000 people. In Portugal there were 124 deaths, with an average age of 47.6 years, corresponding to a crude death rate of 1.17 per 100,000 inhabitants.4 However, it is in the first decades of the 21st century when the number of outstanding cases corresponded entirely to Coronaviridae of the family Coronaviridae, from the Latin corona, given its crown shape under electronic microscope. These viruses belong to a large family of RNA viruses, with abundant expression in the animal kingdom, particularly bats, and also other mammals, birds and reptiles. The first outbreak of coronavirus disease was the result of a cross-species barrier jump, originating in bats, and probably the musk cat as a secondary host, which began on November 16, 2002 and was named SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - CoronaVirus) in Guangdong Province, of the People’s Republic of China, and extended to 17 countries, including Canada, the United States of America (USA), Australia, Germany, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Spain. The WHO declared an end to the risk of new cases on 19 May 2004, with an estimated total of approximately 8096 cases and at least 774 deaths.5","0760e79585cd85c7e9a59f88188b915955aa3926","True","Pulmonology","Earth|1013|20–40|tens of years|the fall|the Roman Empire|the Black Death|the 14th century|nearly a third|the “Spanish”|1918–19|Portugal|a few months|1%|Portuguese|20 years|the World Health Organization|1980|the 20th century|between 300 and 500 million people.3|the 21st century|2009|2010|2009|A (H1N1|Mexico|5–10%|300,000|Portugal|124|47.6 years|1.17|100,000|the first decades of the 21st century|Coronaviridae|Coronaviridae|Latin|RNA|first|secondary|November 16, 2002|CoV|Guangdong Province|the People’s Republic of China|17|Canada|the United States of America|Australia|Germany|France|Sweden|the United Kingdom|Spain|WHO|19 May 2004|approximately 8096|at least 774","els-covid","#4676","","","LOC|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|GPE|LAW|DATE|CARDINAL|EVENT|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|NORP|DATE|ORG|DATE|DATE|MONEY|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|WORK_OF_ART|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|NORP|ORG|ORDINAL|ORDINAL|DATE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-04-30","3006602665","10.1016/j.pulmoe.2020.02.010","custom_license"

Ub is highly conserved across eukaryotes, whereas ISG15 is only present in vertebrates and shows substantial sequence diversity. Prior attempts to address the effect of ISG15 diversity on viral protein-ISG15 interactions have focused on only a single species’ ISG15 or a limited selection of nairovirus OTUs. To gain a more complete perspective of OTU-ISG15 interactions, we biochemically assessed the relative activities of 14 diverse nairovirus OTUs for 12 species’ ISG15 and found that ISG15 activity is predominantly restricted to particular nairovirus lineages reflecting, in general, known virus-host associations. To uncover the underlying molecular factors driving OTUs affinity for ISG15, X-ray crystal structures of Kupe virus and Ganjam virus OTUs bound to sheep ISG15 were solved and compared to complexes of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Erve virus OTUs bound to human and mouse ISG15, respectively. Through mutational and structural analysis seven residues in ISG15 were identified that predominantly influence ISG15 species specificity among nairovirus OTUs. Additionally, OTU residues were identified that influence ISG15 preference, suggesting the potential for viral OTUs to adapt to different host ISG15s.

We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Methods In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. Findings Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. Interpretation The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly. On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources. However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.","","False","Trop Med Health","Thursday|30 January 2020|World Health Organization|Coronavirus disease-2019|International Concern|late December 2019|Wuhan|Hubei Province|People’s Republic of China|COVID-19|COVID-19|RT-PCR|14 days|COVID-19|RT-PCR|COVID-19","cc-by","#5077","PMC7061485","32165854","DATE|DATE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC_new","2020-03-09","2145339500","10.1186/s41182-020-00201-2",""

Health-care systems and human resources are already spread thin.

Along with Ufd1, Npl4 forms a heterodimer (UN), and functions as a cofactor for the Cdc48 ATPase. Here, we report the crystal structures of yeast Npl4 in complex with Lys48-linked diubiquitin and with the Npl4-binding motif of Ufd1. The distal and proximal ubiquitin moieties of Lys48-linked diubiquitin primarily interact with the C-terminal helix and N-terminal loop of the Npl4 C-terminal domain (CTD), respectively. Mutational analysis suggests that the CTD contributes to linkage selectivity and initial binding of ubiquitin chains. Ufd1 occupies a hydrophobic groove of the Mpr1/Pad1 N-terminal (MPN) domain of Npl4, which corresponds to the catalytic groove of the MPN domain of JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM)-family deubiquitylating enzyme.

Meanwhile, the RLR signaling pathway is also tightly regulated by host and virus to achieve the immune homeostasis between antiviral responses and virus survival. Here, we found that zebrafish TRIM25 (zbTRIM25) functioned as a positive regulator of RLR signaling pathway during red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infection. Post-RGNNV infection, zbTRIM25 expression was obviously inhibited and ectopic expression of zbTRIM25 led to enhanced expression of RLR signaling pathway-related genes. Overexpression and knockdown analysis revealed that zbTRIM25 promoted zebrafish RIG-I (zbRIG-I)-mediated IFN signaling and inhibited RGNNV replication. Mechanistically, zbTRIM25 bound to zbRIG-I; in particular, the SPRY domain of zbTRIM25 interacted with the tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARD) and repressor domain (RD) regions of zbRIG-I. zbTRIM25 promoted the K63 polyubiquitination of 2CARD and RD regions of zbRIG-I. Furthermore, zbTRIM25-mediated zbRIG-I activation of IFN production was enhanced by K63-linked ubiquitin, indicating that zbTRIM25-mediated zbRIG-I polyubiquitination was essential for RIG-I-triggered IFN induction. In conclusion, these findings reveal a novel mechanism that zbTRIM25 positively regulates the innate immune response by targeting and promoting the K63-linked polyubiquitination of zbRIG-I.","9a87a6bf36af7342e6bbb2e13da6181a8c0bab27","True","Front Immunol","RLR|RLR|RGNNV|RLR|RIG|zbRIG|IFN|zbRIG|SPRY|2CARD|RD|zbRIG|K63|2CARD|RD|zbRIG|zbRIG|IFN|zbRIG|RIG|IFN|zbRIG","cc-by","","PMC6901795","31849979","ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL","PMC","2019 Dec 3","","10.3389/fimmu.2019.02805","comm_use_subset"

Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection. Methods Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation. Findings All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus. Interpretation The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.

Cyclophilin A (CYPA) is upregulated in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with unknown roles. In the present approach, cytosolic CYPA was found to be bound with EBNA1 into the nucleus. The amino acid 376-459 of the EBNA1 domain was important for the binding. CYPA depletion attenuated and ectopic CYPA expression improved EBNA1 expression in EBV-positive cells. The loss of viral copy number was also accelerated by CYPA consumption in daughter cells during culture passages. Mechanistically, CYPA mediated the connection of EBNA1 with oriP (origin of EBV DNA replication) and subsequent oriP transcription, which is a key step for the initiation of EBV genome replication. Moreover, CYPA overexpression markedly antagonized the connection of EBNA1 to Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7), which is a strong host barrier with a role of inhibiting EBV genome replication. The PPIase activity of CYPA was required for the promotion of oriP transcription and antagonism with USP7. The results revealed a strategy that EBV recruited a host factor to counteract the host defense, thus facilitating its own latent genome replication. This study provides a new insight into EBV pathogenesis and potential virus-targeted therapeutics in EBV-associated NPC, in which CYPA is upregulated at all stages.","d3f515c47fec377ecc7f3961948916239e4e079f","True","Front Microbiol","1|Cyclophilin|A (CYPA|NPC|CYPA|376|CYPA|CYPA|CYPA|CYPA|CYPA|Ubiquitin|7|USP7|PPIase|CYPA|USP7|EBV|NPC|CYPA","cc-by","","PMC6923202","31921057","CARDINAL|PERSON|WORK_OF_ART|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 13","","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02879","comm_use_subset"

Among the 6 cases, 5 (P1-P5) had a history of exposure to Wuhan or Hubei, and P6 had no clear epidemiological history. All the patients performed oropharyngeal swabs test and confirmed as COVID-19. Common respiratory viruses, mycoplasma and chlamydia were negative. For patients’ venous blood tests at disease onset, as given in (Table 1), we found that leucocytes, lymphocytes and percentage were slightly decreased or normal, eosinophil count and percentage were slightly decreased in 4 cases and normal in 2 cases. Additionally, 4 days later, P1 reperformed the follow-up hematologic examination. Compared with the blood test at disease onset, the results showed that the eosinophil count was still below the normal range, which was even lower than the first time.","24b996db83d4d2622d87fb583e6dc6fa277a636f","True","Journal of Infection","Tang JW|al|Journal|2019|CT|2|Six|27 to 63 years|6|5|P1-P5|Wuhan|Hubei|COVID-19|Common|Table 1|4|2|4 days later|first","els-covid","#3478","","","PERSON|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|GPE|ORG|PERSON|WORK_OF_ART|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-03","3005929298","10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.022","custom_license"

We conducted a systematic review of studies on PPE use for respiratory infections in healthcare settings in Pakistan. MEDLINE, Embase and Goggle Scholar were searched for clinical, epidemiological and laboratory-based studies in English, and 13 studies were included; all were observational/cross-sectional studies. The studies examined PPE use in hospital (n=7), dental (n=4) or laboratory (n=2) settings. Policies and practices on PPE use were inconsistent. Face masks and gloves were the most commonly used PPE to protect from respiratory and other infections. PPE was not available in many facilities and its use was limited to high-risk situations. Compliance with PPE use was low among healthcare workers, and reuse of PPE was reported. Clear policies on the use of PPE and available PPE are needed to avoid inappropriate practices that could result in the spread of infection.

Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.","a70e7c4d8ee484ce956e91c8700d0c9310bbdbbc","True","eLife.; 9:e55570","COVID-19|Gostic|2015|more than half|COVID-19","cc-by","#1842","PMC7060038","32091395","ORG|NORP|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG","PMC","2020-02-24","","10.7554/eLife.55570","comm_use_subset"

Our understanding of viral diversity derives primarily from comparisons among host species, precluding insight into how intraspecific variation in host ecology affects viral communities or how predictable viral communities are across populations. Here we test spatial, demographic and environmental hypotheses explaining viral richness and community composition across populations of common vampire bats, which occur in diverse habitats of North, Central and South America. We demonstrate marked variation in viral communities that was not consistently predicted by a null model of declining community similarity with increasing spatial or genetic distances separating populations. We also find no evidence that larger bat colonies host greater viral diversity. Instead, viral diversity follows an elevational gradient, is enriched by juvenile‐biased age structure, and declines with local anthropogenic food resources as measured by livestock density. Our results establish the value of linking the modern influx of metagenomic sequence data with comparative ecology, reveal that snapshot views of viral diversity are unlikely to be representative at the species level, and affirm existing ecological theories that link host ecology not only to single pathogen dynamics but also to viral communities.","c2a69ec62b5553d158b04c9a91409e451f91e2ee; 8ca98b59fa6bb5b1d4dfdb0b89cfcdbcaa1a0474","True","Mol Ecol","North, Central and South America|colonies","cc-by","","PMC7004108","31561274","ORG|GPE","PMC","2020 Jan 23","","10.1111/mec.15250","comm_use_subset"

Although several PDCoV studies have been conducted in China, more sequence information is needed to understand the molecular characterization of PDCoV. In this study, the partial ORF1a, spike protein (S) and nucleocapsid protein (N) were sequenced from Shandong Province between 2017 and 2018. The sequencing results for the S protein from 10 PDCoV strains showed 96.7 %–99.7 % nucleotide sequence identity with the China lineage strains, while sharing a lower level of nucleotide sequence identity, ranging from 95.7 to 96.8%, with the Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage strains. N protein sequencing analysis showed that these strains showed nucleotide homologies of 97.3%–99.3% with the reference strains. Phylogenetic analyses based on S protein sequences showed that these PDCoV strains were classified into the China lineage. The discontinuous 2 + 3 aa deletions at 400–401 and 758–760 were found in the Nsp2 and Nsp3 coding region in five strains, respectively, with similar deletions having been identified in Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos. Three novel patterns of deletion were observed for the first time in the Nsp2 and Nsp3 regions.

An emerging field of microfluidics also known as the lab-on-a-chip (LOC) or micro total analysis system includes a wide range of diagnostic devices. This review briefly covers both conventional and microfluidics-based techniques for rapid viral detection. We first describe conventional detection methods such as cell culturing, immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These methods often have limited speed, sensitivity, or specificity and are performed with typically bulky equipment. Here, we discuss some of the LOC technologies that can overcome these demerits, highlighting the latest advances in LOC devices for viral disease diagnosis. We also discuss the fabrication of LOC systems to produce devices for performing either individual steps or virus detection in samples with the sample to answer method. The complete system consists of sample preparation, and ELISA and RT-PCR for viral-antibody and nucleic acid detection, respectively. Finally, we formulate our opinions on these areas for the future development of LOC systems for viral diagnostics.","757406d6fbd32ec354c631d76e8b5a627f5a1de8","True","Biosensors and Bioelectronics","first|enzyme|ELISA|RT-PCR|LOC|LOC|LOC|ELISA|RT-PCR|LOC","els-covid","#156","","31999560","ORDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-04-01","3002683399","10.1016/j.bios.2020.112041","custom_license"

Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.","","False","Emerg Microbes Infect","2019|2019-nCoV|more than 11,900|259|RBD|2019-nCoV|CoV|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV.|first|CoV|CR3022|2019-nCoV|RBD|KD|6.3 nM|CR3022|2019-nCoV|RBD|CR3022|2019-nCoV|CoV|CR3014|CoV|2019-nCoV|RBD|CoV|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|RBD","cc-by","#1100","PMC7048180","32065055","DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|PERSON|PRODUCT|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|MONEY|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|PRODUCT|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","PMC_new","2020-02-17","3003227632","10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069",""

However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease data come from KSA, the cancellation of Umrah by the KSA authorities, prior to emergence of cases, provide the best opportunity to develop mathematical models to quantify event cancellations related mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in KSA and to the home countries of pilgrims. COVID-19 has already provided examples of both clearly planned event cancellations such as the Umrah suspension in KSA, and where outbreaks and events were continued.","b1a618916f4cac86f64075e52539cd2388004264","True","Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","MG|2009|H1N1 Public Health Emergency|International Concern|PHEIC|the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|KSA|annual|over 3 million|180|PHEIC COVID-19|MG|KSA|Umrah|KSA|COVID-19|KSA|COVID-19|Umrah|KSA","els-covid","#5673","","","GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-09","","10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101617","custom_license"

The highest number of MERS-CoV cases are from Saudi-Arabia, the major worldwide hotspot for this disease. In the absence of neither effective treatment nor a ready-to-use vaccine and with yet an incomplete understanding of its epidemiological cycle, prevention and containment measures can be derived from mathematical models of disease epidemiology. We constructed 2-strain models to predict past outbreaks in the interval 2012–2016 and derive key epidemiological information for Macca, Madina and Riyadh. We approached variability in infection through three different disease incidence functions capturing social behavior in response to an epidemic (e.g. Bilinear, BL; Non-monotone, NM; and Saturated, SAT models). The best model combination successfully anticipated the total number of MERS-CoV clinical cases for the 2015–2016 season and accurately predicted both the number of cases at the peak of seasonal incidence and the overall shape of the epidemic cycle. The evolution in the basic reproduction number (R(0)) warns that MERS-CoV may easily take an epidemic form. The best model correctly captures this feature, indicating a high epidemic risk (1≤R(0)≤2,5) in Riyadh and Macca and confirming the alleged co-circulation of more than one strain. Accurate predictions of the future MERS-CoV peak week, as well as the number of cases at the peak are now possible. These results indicate public health agencies should be aware that measures for strict containment are urgently needed before new epidemics take off in the region.","c351ce11cb0157d1118dfcbb55cf9f8bab0ad35d","True","PLoS Negl Trop Dis","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus|35,5%|MERS-CoV|Saudi-Arabia|2-strain|2012–2016|Macca|Madina|Riyadh|three|BL|Non-monotone|NM|Saturated|SAT|CoV|the 2015–2016 season|R(0|CoV|Riyadh|Macca|more than one|week","cc-by","#7275","PMC7046297","32059047","ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|QUANTITY|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|GPE|GPE|ORG|PERSON|DATE|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE","PMC","2020 Feb 14","","10.1371/journal.pntd.0008065","comm_use_subset"

Therefore, identification of EGFR mutations is essential. In the present study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was used to identify EGFR mutations, and its efficiency was compared with the Therascreen quantitative PCR assay. Using LAMP and Therascreen to analyze surgically resected tissue samples from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutations were observed in 32/59 tumor samples (LAMP) and 33/59 tumor samples (Therascreen). Notably, the LAMP assay identified one tumor as wild-type, which had previously been identified as a deletion mutation in exon 19 via the Therascreen assay (Case X). However, the direct sequencing to confirm the EGFR status of the Case X adhered to the results of the LAMP assay. Further experiments using Case X DNA identified this exon 19 deletion mutation using both methods. In addition, a novel deletion mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR was identified.

Methods We collected data from ten COVID-19 patients admitted between January 22, 2020 and February 11, 2020 at Xixi hospital in Hangzhou, China. Results Of ten patients, secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged, the incubation period was 3–7 days. Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3–38.0 ℃). An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others existed ground glass opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir using because of adverse effect, two of them deteriorated, one hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir using. Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge. Viral load of SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3–14, 6–8 and 7–9 days, respectively. Conclusions Increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of COVID-19 improvement.

It exhibits measurable levels of cytotoxicity, with 50% cytotoxic concentration values ranging from 7.5 μM in CEM cells and up to >100 μM in other cell lines. The mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POLRMT) has been shown to incorporate some nucleotide analogs into mitochondrial RNAs, resulting in substantial mitochondrial toxicity. NHC was tested in multiple assays intended to determine its potential to cause mitochondrial toxicity. NHC showed similar cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells incubated in a glucose-free and glucose-containing media, suggesting that NHC does not impair mitochondrial function in this cell line based on the Crabtree effect. We demonstrate that the 5′-triphosphate of NHC can be used by POLRMT for incorporation into nascent RNA chain but does not cause immediate chain termination. In PC-3 cells treated with NHC, the 50% inhibitory concentrations of mitochondrial protein expression inhibition were 2.7-fold lower than those for nuclear-encoded protein expression, but this effect did not result in selective mitochondrial toxicity. A 14-day incubation of HepG2 cells with NHC had no effect on mitochondrial DNA copy number or extracellular lactate levels. In CEM cells treated with NHC at 10 μM, a slight decrease (by ∼20%) in mitochondrial DNA copy number and a corresponding slight increase in extracellular lactate levels were detected, but these effects were not enhanced by an increase in NHC treatment concentration. In summary, the results indicate that mitochondrial impairment by NHC is not the main contributor to the compound’s observed cytotoxicity in these cell lines.","55f72abf2de5e0b70b27e9ed512b9e456407b680; bf30ca226d68a47371af20b85605f7c8550d2dd4","True","Antimicrob Agents Chemother","RNA|RNA|50%|7.5 μM|100 μM|RNA|HepG2|Crabtree|POLRMT|RNA|50%|2.7-fold|14-day|HepG2|10 μM|∼20%","cc-by","","PMC6985706","31767721","ORG|ORG|PERCENT|QUANTITY|QUANTITY|ORG|ORG|NORP|PERSON|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|TIME|PERCENT","PMC","2020 Jan 27","","10.1128/AAC.01719-19","comm_use_subset"

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Findings 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. Interpretation The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

They are proposed to form stacking interactions with polypurine sequences in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of selected mRNAs, thereby clamping the RNA substrate onto eIF4A and causing inhibition of the translation initiation complex. Since virus replication relies on the host translation machinery, it is not surprising that the rocaglate Silvestrol has broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Unfortunately, synthesis of Silvestrol is sophisticated and time-consuming, thus hampering the prospects for further antiviral drug development. Here, we present the less complex structured synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (−) as a novel compound with potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity in primary cells and in an ex vivo bronchial epithelial cell system. CR-31-B (−) inhibited the replication of corona-, Zika-, Lassa-, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses and, to a lesser extent, hepatitis E virus (HEV) at non-cytotoxic low nanomolar concentrations. Since HEV has a polypurine-free 5′-UTR that folds into a stable hairpin structure, we hypothesized that RNA clamping by Silvestrol and its derivatives may also occur in a polypurine-independent but structure-dependent manner. Interestingly, the HEV 5′-UTR conferred sensitivity towards Silvestrol but not to CR-31-B (−). However, if an exposed polypurine stretch was introduced into the HEV 5′-UTR, CR-31-B (−) became an active inhibitor comparable to Silvestrol. Moreover, thermodynamic destabilization of the HEV 5′-UTR led to reduced translational inhibition by Silvestrol, suggesting differences between rocaglates in their mode of action, most probably by engaging Silvestrol's additional dioxane moiety.","aa264b65408831a37b2943b60805e3773e0acaa5","True","Antiviral Research","Aglaia|5′-untranslated|UTR|mRNAs|RNA|eIF4A|Silvestrol|Silvestrol|CR-31-B|CR-31-B|Lassa-|Crimean Congo|HEV|5′-UTR|RNA|Silvestrol|5′-UTR|Silvestrol|CR-31-B|5′-UTR|CR-31-B|Silvestrol|5′-UTR|Silvestrol|Silvestrol","els-covid","#2162","","31931103","ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|LOC|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|DATE|PERSON|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104706","custom_license"

To lower the risk of further disease transmission, the authority in Wuhan suspended public transport indefinitely from Jan 23, 2020; similar measures were adopted soon in many other cities in China. As of Jan 25, 2020, 30 Chinese provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions covering over 1·3 billion people have initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. A range of measures has been urgently adopted,1,2 such as early identification and isolation of suspected and diagnosed cases, contact tracing and monitoring, collection of clinical data and biological samples from patients, dissemination of regional and national diagnostic criteria and expert treatment consensus, establishment of isolation units and hospitals, and prompt provision of medical supplies and external expert teams to Hubei province. The emergence of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia has parallels with the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was caused by another coronavirus that killed 349 of 5327 patients with confirmed infection in China.3 Although the diseases have different clinical presentations, the infectious cause, epidemiological features, fast transmission pattern, and insufficient preparedness of health authorities to address the outbreaks are similar. So far, mental health care for the patients and health professionals directly affected by the 2019-nCoV epidemic has been under-addressed, although the National Health Commission of China released the notification of basic principles for emergency psychological crisis interventions for the 2019-nCoV pneumonia on Jan 26, 2020. This notification contained a reference to mental health problems and interventions that occurred during the 2003 SARS outbreak, and mentioned that mental health care should be provided for patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonitis, close contacts, suspected cases who are isolated at home, patients in fever clinics, families and friends of affected people, health professionals caring for infected patients, and the public who are in need. To date, epidemiological data on the mental health problems and psychiatric morbidity of those suspected or diagnosed with the 2019-nCoV and their treating health professionals have not been available; therefore how best to respond to challenges during the outbreak is unknown. The observations of mental health consequences and measures taken during the 2003 SARS outbreak could help inform health authorities and the public to provide mental health interventions to those who are in need.","bd15a966677353011a4612a91649b11306e87691","True","The Lancet Psychiatry","2019|2019-nCoV|Wuhan|Hubei|China|the end of 2019|Wuhan|Jan 23, 2020|China|Jan 25, 2020|30|Chinese|first|Hubei|2019-nCoV|2003|349|5327|2019-nCoV|the National Health Commission of China|2019-nCoV|Jan 26, 2020|2003|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|2003","els-covid","#207","","32032543","DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|NORP|ORDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE","Elsevier","2020-03-31","3004804052","10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30046-8","custom_license"

This study aimed to describe secondary cases of MERS-CoV infection among healthcare workers and to identify risk factors for death. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on epidemiological data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to the World Health Organization from September 2012 to 2 June 2018. We compared all secondary cases among healthcare workers with secondary cases among non-healthcare workers. Multivariable logistic regression identified risk factors for death. Results Of the 2223 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO, 415 were healthcare workers and 1783 were non-healthcare workers. Compared with non-healthcare workers cases, healthcare workers cases were younger (P < 0.001), more likely to be female (P < 0.001), non-nationals (P < 0.001) and asymptomatic (P < 0.001), and have fewer comorbidities (P < 0.001) and higher rates of survival (P < 0.001). Year of infection (2013–2018) and having no comorbidities were independent protective factors against death among secondary healthcare workers cases. Conclusion Being able to protect healthcare workers from high threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV is important for being able to reduce secondary transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare-associated outbreaks. By extension, reducing infection in healthcare workers improves continuity of care for all patients within healthcare facilities.","5ec1bf2fc5d286672feb316e70accdd302d7ed50","True","Journal of Infection and Public Health","Approximately half|Middle East|one third|CoV|CoV|the World Health Organization|September 2012|2 June 2018|2223|CoV|WHO|415|1783|0.001|0.001|0.001|0.001|0.001|0.001|2013–2018|CoV","els-covid","#7352","","31056437","CARDINAL|LOC|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|DATE|DATE|DATE|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-03-31","","10.1016/j.jiph.2019.04.011","custom_license"

We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID-19 with LPV/r only. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age≥18years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020. Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5–21 days. The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7). Results We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after diagnosis. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups. The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected for 12(75%) of 16 patients’ nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after seven days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p<0•05).

"Yang, Chu-Wen; Chen, Mei-Fang","Composition of human-specific slow codons and slow di-codons in SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV are lower than other coronaviruses suggesting a faster protein synthesis rate of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV","Abstract Translation of a genetic codon without a cognate tRNA gene is affected by both the cognate tRNA availability and the interaction with non-cognate isoacceptor tRNAs. Moreover, two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much slower translation rate. Calculating the composition of host specific slow codons and slow di-codons in the viral protein coding sequences can predict the order of viral protein synthesis rates between different virus strains. Comparison of human-specific slow codon and slow di-codon compositions in the genomes of 590 coronaviruses infect humans revealed that the protein synthetic rates of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may be much faster than other coronaviruses infect humans. Analysis of host-specific slow codon and di-codon compositions provides links between viral genomic sequences and capability of virus replication in host cells that may be useful for surveillance of the transmission potential of novel viruses.","3930eb95cd8e6238a807895b52020843561af7c2","True","Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection","two|590|2019|2019-nCoV|CoV","els-covid","#5978","","","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-03-10","","10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.002","custom_license"

Liver impairment has been reported in up to 60% of patients with SARS3 and has also been reported in patients infected with MERS-CoV.4 At least seven relatively large-scale case studies have reported the clinical features of patients with COVID-19.1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 In this Comment, we assess how the liver is affected using the available case studies and data from The Fifth Medical Center of PLS General Hospital, Beijing, China. These data indicate that 2–11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver comorbidities and 14–53% cases reported abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) during disease progression (table). Patients with severe COVID-19 seem to have higher rates of liver dysfunction. In a study in The Lancet by Huang and colleagues,5 elevation of AST was observed in eight (62%) of 13 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) compared with seven (25%) of 28 patients who did not require care in the ICU. Moreover, in a large cohort including 1099 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces or provincial municipalities, more severe patients with disease had abnormal liver aminotransferase levels than did non-severe patients with disease.1 Furthermore, in another study,8 patients who had a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by CT scan while in the subclinical phase (ie, before symptom onset) had significantly lower incidence of AST abnormality than did patients diagnosed after the onset of symptoms.

"Smith, Julia; Sears, Nathan; Taylor, Ben; Johnson, Madeline","Serious games for serious crises: reflections from an infectious disease outbreak matrix game","BACKGROUND: While there is widespread recognition of global health failures when it comes to infectious disease outbreaks, there is little discussion on how policy-makers and global health organizations can learn to better prepare and respond. Serious games provide an underutilized tool to promote learning and innovation around global health crises. In order to explore the potential of Serious Games as a policy learning tool, Global Affairs Canada, in collaboration with the Department of National Defense and academic partners, developed and implemented a matrix game aimed at prompting critical reflection and gender-based analysis on infectious disease outbreak preparedness and response. This commentary, written by the core development team, reflects on the process and outcomes of the gaming exercise, which we believe will be of interest to others hoping to promote innovative thinking and learning around global health policy and crisis response, as well as the application of serious games more broadly. MAIN BODY: Participants reported, through discussions and a post-game survey, that they felt the game was reflective of real-world decision-making and priority-setting challenges during a crisis. They reflected on the challenges that emerge around global health co-operation and outbreak preparedness, particularly noting the importance of learning to work with private actors. While participants only sporadically applied gender-based analysis or considered the social determinants of health during the game, post-game discussions led to reflection on the ways in which equity concerns are put aside during a crisis scenario and on why this happens, offering critical learning opportunities. CONCLUSION: Matrix games provide opportunities for policy-makers and health professionals to experience the challenges of global health co-operation, test ideas and explore how biases, such as those around gender, influence policy-making and implementation. Due to their flexibility, adaptability and accessibility, serious games offer a potentially powerful learning tool for global health policy-makers and practitioners.","","False","Global Health","Serious Games|Global Affairs Canada|the Department of National Defense|MAIN BODY|Matrix","cc-by","#5764","PMC7063729","32151263","EVENT|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERSON","PMC_new","2020-03-10","","10.1186/s12992-020-00547-6",""

In this crisis, what role can companies play? Public and private companies must continue to produce or provide their services, but with consideration of the health context. Many companies are involved with the COVID-19 outbreak because they are established in or work with China (client or supplier), and most have already activated their business continuity planning or equivalent. During an infectious disease outbreak like COVID-19, most large companies around the world have a major part to play, especially in terms of preparedness and emergency response. Indeed, companies should be integrated into the governmental health contingency plan developed in many countries, and by WHO and the International Labor Organization. Helped by their occupational practitioners, healthcare advisers, and safety professionals, companies that have a financial capacity and responsibilities (including governmental, federal, or state administrations) will thus have to prepare their business continuity planning for when cases of infected patients occur in the company. They also must be prepared for the potential psychosocial and psychological effects of outbreaks.

Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that these lncRNAs might be involved in numerous biological processes. Clustering analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs showed that 454 annotated and 376 novel lncRNAs were regulated after PDCoV infection. Furthermore, we constructed a lncRNA-protein-coding gene co-expression interaction network. The KEGG analysis of the co-expressed genes showed that these differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in pathways related to metabolism and TNF signaling. Our study provided comprehensive information about lncRNAs that would be a useful resource for studying the pathogenesis of and designing antiviral therapy for PDCoV infection.","c9fee561c2a3834645dbb61dc4ae6448051da492","True","Front Microbiol","PDCoV|1,308|1,190|Gene Ontology|Kyoto Encyclopedia|Genes|Genomes (KEGG|lncRNAs|454|376|KEGG|TNF","cc-by","#5462","PMC6999024","32063887","GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|GPE|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 28","3003967510","10.3389/fmicb.2019.03036","comm_use_subset"

The strain CHN-JS-2017 was isolated and identified by cytopathology, immunofluorescence assays, transmission electron microscopy, and sequence analysis. A nucleotide sequence alignment showed that the whole genome of CHN-JS-2017 is 97.4%–99.6% identical to other PDCoV strains. The pathogenicity of the CHN-JS-2017 strain was investigated in orally inoculated five-day-old piglets; the piglets developed acute, watery diarrhea, but all recovered and survived. CHN-JS-2017 infection-induced microscopic lesions were observed, and viral antigens were detected mainly by immunohistochemical staining in the small intestine. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) are crucial immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors for the transcytosis ofimmunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, or IgM. Importantly, CHN-JS-2017 infected five-day-old piglets could significantly down-regulate the expression of FcRn, pIgR, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)in the intestinal mucosa. Note that the level of FcRn mRNA in the intestinal mucosa of normal piglets is positively correlated with pIgR and NF-κB. At the same time, the expressions of FcRn, pIgR, and NF-κB mRNA are also positively correlated in infected piglets. These results may help explain the immunological and pathological changes associated with porcine deltacorononirus infection.","95cd65dbf317e24c13557dbf46ffbaa4c206f8be","True","Viruses","CHN-JS-2017|97.4%–99.6%|CHN-JS-2017|five-day-old|Fc|FcRn|Ig|G (IgG)|IgA|IgM.|CHN-JS-2017|five-day-old|FcRn|FcRn|NF-κB.|NF-κB","cc-by","","PMC7019308","31936476","ORG|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|FAC|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP","PMC","2020 Jan 9","","10.3390/v12010079","comm_use_subset"

As the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-19) outbreak spreads [2], ICUs outside of China need to prepare for a potential surge of critically ill patients and counter the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 [3]. Liu et al. have described their important preparations [4], and we would like to expand on their good advice by sharing lessons learnt from our early experience. By 17 February 2020, Singapore recorded the highest number of confirmed cases outside of mainland China with several clusters of local transmission. All healthcare institutions adopted a common strategy of containment, with isolation of all suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in negative-pressure rooms. We were fortunate that most ICU beds were single rooms—this infrastructure was put in place following the outbreak of SARS in 2003. We realized preparing ICUs for patients with COVID-19 had numerous other requirements. First, infection control not only involved strict adherence to personal protective equipment for the individual, but also involved changes in group dynamics. We organized our ICU to mitigate the effects of any infected staff by avoiding potential spread between teams (see Table 1). Related to infection control, the medical ICU was given the task to cohort suspect or confirmed cases, including with peri- and post-partum care of pregnant women. Second, evolving information necessitated rapid and regular communications with large, disparate groups of clinicians.AU - Siow, Wen Ting","","False","Crit Care","About a third|2|ICU|1|disease-19|2|China|3|Liu|al|4|17 February 2020|Singapore|China|COVID-19|ICU|2003|COVID-19|First|ICU|1|ICU|Second|Wen Ting","cc-by","#5802","PMC7063757","32151274","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|DATE|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORDINAL|PERSON","PMC_new","2020-03-09","","10.1186/s13054-020-2814-x",""

Dromedary camels are a likely source of infection and the virus probably originated in Africa. We studied the genetic diversity, geographical structure, infection prevalence, and age-associated prevalence among camels at the largest entry port of camels from Africa into the Arabian Peninsula. METHODS: In this prospective genomic study, we took nasal samples from camels imported from Sudan and Djibouti into the Port of Jeddah in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, over an almost 2-year period and local Arabian camels over 2 months in the year after surveillance of the port. We determined the prevalence of MERS-CoV infection, age-associated patterns of infection, and undertook phylogeographical and migration analyses to determine intercountry virus transmission after local lineage establishment. We compared all virological characteristics between the local and imported cohorts. We compared major gene deletions between African and Arabian strains of the virus. Reproductive numbers were inferred with Bayesian birth death skyline analyses. FINDINGS: Between Aug 10, 2016, and May 3, 2018, we collected samples from 1196 imported camels, of which 868 originated from Sudan and 328 from Djibouti, and between May 1, and June 25, 2018, we collected samples from 472 local camels, of which 189 were from Riyadh and 283 were from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Virus prevalence was higher in local camels than in imported camels (224 [47·5%] of 472 vs 157 [13·1%] of 1196; p<0·0001). Infection prevalence peaked among camels older than 1 year and aged up to 2 years in both groups, with 255 (66·9%) of 381 positive cases in this age group. Although the overall geographical distribution of the virus corresponded with the phylogenetic tree topology, some virus exchange was observed between countries corresponding with trade routes in the region. East and west African strains of the virus appear to be geographically separated, with an origin of west African strains in east Africa. African strains of the virus were not re-sampled in Saudi Arabia despite sampling approximately 1 year after importation from Africa. All local Arabian samples contained strains of the virus that belong to a novel recombinant clade (NRC) first detected in 2014 in Saudi Arabia. Reproduction number estimates informed by the sequences suggest sustained endemicity of NRC, with a mean R(e) of 1·16.

Following our previous finding that Caenorhabditis elegans shut down germ cell proliferation in response to pyrimidine deprivation, we find in this study that endonuclease ENDU-2 regulates nucleotide metabolism and germ cell proliferation in response to nucleotide imbalance and other genotoxic stress, and that it affects mitotic chromosomal segregation in the intestine and lifespan. ENDU-2 expression is induced by nucleotide imbalance and genotoxic stress, and ENDU-2 exerts its function in the intestine, mostly by inhibiting the phosphorylation of CTPS-1 through repressing the PKA pathway and histone deacetylase HDA-1. Human EndoU also affects the response to genotoxic drugs. Our work reveals an unknown role of ENDU-2 in regulating nucleotide metabolism and animals’ response to genotoxic stress, which may link EndoU function to cancer treatment.","4ebe630a2d802a7d6f2402a88c3dc88e7497dcfd; 618a793838421a7bf238e8f6ae2635ca3d2f5a25","True","Cell Rep","Caenorhabditis|ENDU-2|ENDU-2|ENDU-2|PKA|HDA-1|ENDU-2|animals’","cc-by-nc-nd","","PMC7050212","32049015","ORG|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|PERSON|GPE|PERSON","PMC","2020 Feb 11","","10.1016/j.celrep.2020.01.050","noncomm_use_subset"

While feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) manipulates the host early innate immune response in many different ways, the host could activate the antiviral response to counteract it through some unknown mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) which serve as a class of regulatory factors in the host, participate in the regulation of the host innate immune response against virus infection. In this study, we found that the expression levels of miR-26a were significantly upregulated upon FHV-1 infection. Furthermore, FHV-1 infection induced the expression of miR-26a via a cGAS-dependent pathway, and knockdown of cellular cGAS significantly blocked the expression of miR-26a induced by poly (dA:dT) or FHV-1 infection. Next, we investigated the biological function of miR-26a during viral infection. miR-26a was able to increase the phosphorylation of STAT1 and promote type I IFN signaling, thus inhibiting viral replication. The mechanism study showed that miR-26a directly targeted host SOCS5. Knockdown of SOCS5 increased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and enhanced the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response, and overexpression of suppressor of the cytokine signalling 5 (SOCS5) decreased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and inhibited the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response. Meanwhile, with the knockdown of SOCS5, the upregulated expression of phosphorylated STAT1 and the anti-virus effect induced by miR-26a were significantly inhibited. Taken together, our data demonstrated a new strategy of host miRNAs against FHV-1 infection by enhancing IFN antiviral signaling.","37215fa618869df1820d22f28bace99ea9ceb1fc","True","Viruses","feline|1|MicroRNAs|cellular cGAS|dA|STAT1|IFN|SOCS5|Knockdown|SOCS5|STAT1|IFN|5|SOCS5|STAT1|IFN|SOCS5|STAT1|anti|miRNAs","cc-by","","PMC7020096","31861450","DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL","PMC","2019 Dec 18","","10.3390/v12010002","comm_use_subset"

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was used to treat H7N9-induced ARDS in 2013. The transplant of MSCs into patients with H7N9-induced ARDS was conducted at a single center through an open-label clinical trial. Based on the principles of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS were included as a control group, while 17 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS acted as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual-blood-derived MSCs. It was notable that MSC transplantation significantly lowered the mortality of the experimental group, compared with the control group (17.6% died in the experimental group while 54.5% died in the control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in the bodies of four of the patients who were part of the five-year follow-up period. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve the survival rate of H7N9-induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9-induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (e.g., ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.","f6df5270d9c9764c3a7dce8ec9c3a9eaf22eaab4","True","Engineering","2013|ARDS|ARDS|2013|ARDS|44|ARDS|17|ARDS|MSC|17.6%|54.5%|MSC|four|five-year|ARDS|ARDS|2019|COVID-19|ARDS|MSC|COVID-19","els-covid","#7452","","","DATE|ORG|ORG|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|PERSON|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-02-28","","10.1016/j.eng.2020.02.006","custom_license"
"Khanna, Varun; Li, Lei; Fung, Johnson; Ranganathan, Shoba; Petrovsky, Nikolai","Prediction of novel mouse TLR9 agonists using a random forest approach","BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptor 9 is a key innate immune receptor involved in detecting infectious diseases and cancer. TLR9 activates the innate immune system following the recognition of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs. Due to the considerable number of rotatable bonds in ODNs, high-throughput in silico screening for potential TLR9 activity via traditional structure-based virtual screening approaches of CpG ODNs is challenging. In the current study, we present a machine learning based method for predicting novel mouse TLR9 (mTLR9) agonists based on features including count and position of motifs, the distance between the motifs and graphically derived features such as the radius of gyration and moment of Inertia. We employed an in-house experimentally validated dataset of 396 single-stranded synthetic ODNs, to compare the results of five machine learning algorithms. Since the dataset was highly imbalanced, we used an ensemble learning approach based on repeated random down-sampling. RESULTS: Using in-house experimental TLR9 activity data we found that random forest algorithm outperformed other algorithms for our dataset for TLR9 activity prediction. Therefore, we developed a cross-validated ensemble classifier of 20 random forest models. The average Matthews correlation coefficient and balanced accuracy of our ensemble classifier in test samples was 0.61 and 80.0%, respectively, with the maximum balanced accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient of 87.0% and 0.75, respectively. We confirmed common sequence motifs including ‘CC’, ‘GG’,‘AG’, ‘CCCG’ and ‘CGGC’ were overrepresented in mTLR9 agonists. Predictions on 6000 randomly generated ODNs were ranked and the top 100 ODNs were synthesized and experimentally tested for activity in a mTLR9 reporter cell assay, with 91 of the 100 selected ODNs showing high activity, confirming the accuracy of the model in predicting mTLR9 activity. CONCLUSION: We combined repeated random down-sampling with random forest to overcome the class imbalance problem and achieved promising results. Overall, we showed that the random forest algorithm outperformed other machine learning algorithms including support vector machines, shrinkage discriminant analysis, gradient boosting machine and neural networks. Due to its predictive performance and simplicity, the random forest technique is a useful method for prediction of mTLR9 ODN agonists.","af987eff63f3d7ee36dc7631807d9aac7c165d2d","True","BMC Mol Cell Biol","9|ODN|CpG|CpG|mTLR9|Inertia|396|five|20|Matthews|0.61|80.0%|Matthews|87.0%|0.75|‘CC’|mTLR9|6000|100|mTLR9|91|100|mTLR9|mTLR9 ODN","cc-by","","PMC6924143","31856726","CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|GPE|PERCENT|NORP|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 20","","10.1186/s12860-019-0241-0","comm_use_subset"

This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated—Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provide effective treatment of patients, and involved consultation with three major groups in policy formulation—public health experts, the government, and the general public. It was also aided by media and information technology, as well as international cooperation. This experience will provide China and other countries with valuable lessons for quickly coordinating and coping with future public health emergencies.","50765f980de37a832825bd81ad612e3afc75258b","True","Microbes and Infection","Only a month|2019-nCoV|more than forty-thousand|Chinese|the 25th day|Chinese|2019-nCoV|Wuhan|Ten days later|Hubei|0.0001|China|three|China","els-covid","#1367","","32088333","DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|NORP|DATE|NORP|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-31","2321034157","10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.004","custom_license"

However, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil transmigration, location and accumulation in the ischemic brain are not fully elucidated. Neutrophils can reach the perivascular spaces of brain vessels after crossing the endothelial cell layer and endothelial basal lamina of post-capillary venules, or migrating from the leptomeninges following pial vessel extravasation and/or a suggested translocation from the skull bone marrow. Based on previous observations of microglia phagocytosing neutrophils recruited to the ischemic brain lesion, we hypothesized that microglial cells might control neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain. We studied a model of permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice, including microglia- and neutrophil-reporter mice. Using various in vitro and in vivo strategies to impair microglial function or to eliminate microglia by targeting colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), this study demonstrates that microglial phagocytosis of neutrophils has fundamental consequences for the ischemic tissue. We found that reactive microglia engulf neutrophils at the periphery of the ischemic lesion, whereas local microglial cell loss and dystrophy occurring in the ischemic core are associated with the accumulation of neutrophils first in perivascular spaces and later in the parenchyma. Accordingly, microglia depletion by long-term treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor increased the numbers of neutrophils and enlarged the ischemic lesion. Hence, microglial phagocytic function sets a critical line of defense against the vascular and tissue damaging capacity of neutrophils in brain ischemia.

In an Ebola treatment center in Liberia, EVD patients receiving the combination antimalarial artesunate-amodiaquine had a lower risk of death compared to those treated with artemether-lumefantrine. As artemether and artesunate are derivatives of artemisinin, the beneficial anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) effect observed could possibly be attributed to the change from lumefantrine to amodiaquine. Amodiaquine is a widely used antimalarial in the countries that experience outbreaks of EVD and, therefore, holds promise as an approved drug that could be repurposed for treating EBOV infections. We investigated the potential anti-EBOV effect of amodiaquine in a well-characterized nonhuman primate model of EVD. Using a similar 3-day antimalarial dosing strategy as for human patients, plasma concentrations of amodiaquine in healthy animals were similar to those found in humans. However, the treatment regimen did not result in a survival benefit or decrease of disease signs in EBOV-infected animals.

On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2). As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.(†) On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary declared a U.S. public health emergency to respond to 2019-nCoV.(§) Also on January 31, the president of the United States signed a "Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus," which limits entry into the United States of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their families (3). CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5). These measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United States and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland China to the United States. These measures are being implemented in anticipation of additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely. As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC and state and local health departments.","11f13e2859eb22b349dbef68fd8124b8ba445aac","True","MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep","December 31, 2019|Chinese|Hunan|Wuhan|Hubei Province|China|January 7, 2020|Chinese|2019-nCoV|1|February 4, 2020|20,471|2,788|13.6%|425|2.1%|the National Health Commission of China|2|26|China|one|2|February 4|11|the United States|January 30|the World Health Organization|2019-nCoV|January 31|the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|HHS|U.S.|2019-nCoV.(§|January 31|the United States|Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as|Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons|Pose|Transmitting 2019|Novel Coronavirus|the United States|China|U.S.|3|CDC|2019-nCoV|the United States|4,5|the United States|China|the United States|2019-nCoV|the United States|the United States|1|2|3|2019-nCoV|CDC|CDC","cc-by","#454","PMC7004396","32027631","DATE|NORP|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|DATE|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|QUANTITY|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|GPE|LAW|ORG|PERSON|DATE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|NORP|GPE|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 7","3004775012","10.15585/mmwr.mm6905e1","comm_use_subset"

We hypothesized that the liver, as a central metabolic hub, may orchestrate systemic metabolic changes during infection. We infected mice with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), performed RNA sequencing and proteomics of liver tissue, and integrated these data with serum metabolomics at different infection phases. Widespread reprogramming of liver metabolism occurred early after infection, correlating with type I interferon (IFN-I) responses. Viral infection induced metabolic alterations of the liver that depended on the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR1). Hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 repressed the transcription of metabolic genes, including Otc and Ass1, which encode urea cycle enzymes. This led to decreased arginine and increased ornithine concentrations in the circulation, resulting in suppressed virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses and ameliorated liver pathology. These findings establish IFN-I-induced modulation of hepatic metabolism and the urea cycle as an endogenous mechanism of immunoregulation.

Dromedary vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing hopeful results, but gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in dromedaries must be addressed to design and evaluate potential vaccination strategies. We aim to bring together existing measures of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels to assess the distribution of infection, highlighting knowledge gaps and implications for animal vaccination. We systematically reviewed the published literature on MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science that reported seroprevalence and/or prevalence of active MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. 60 studies met our eligibility criteria. Qualitative syntheses determined that MERS-CoV seroprevalence increased with age up to 80–100% in adult dromedaries supporting geographically widespread endemicity of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in both the Arabian Peninsula and countries exporting dromedaries from Africa. The high prevalence of active infection measured in juveniles and at sites where dromedary populations mix should guide further investigation – particularly of dromedary movement – and inform vaccination strategy design and evaluation through mathematical modelling.","940d88b37322a92e95ae08ab755481bef84805cb; 1cc16427f0accab0051485dbbb73dbce1d0848e4","True","Epidemics","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus|CoV|MEDLINE|EMBASE|CoV|60|CoV|up to 80–100%|the Arabian Peninsula|Africa","cc-by","","PMC6899506","31201040","ORG|PERSON|GPE|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERCENT|LOC|LOC","PMC","2019 Dec","","10.1016/j.epidem.2019.100350","comm_use_subset"

Several studies have been done to estimate the basic reproduction number in the early phase of this outbreak, yet there are no reliable estimates of case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 to date. METHODS: In this study, we used a purely data-driven statistical method to estimate the CFR in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Daily numbers of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths were collected from January 10 to February 3, 2020 and divided into three clusters: Wuhan city, other cities of Hubei province, and other provinces of mainland China. Simple linear regression model was applied to estimate the CFR from each cluster. RESULTS: We estimated that CFR during the first weeks of the epidemic ranges from 0.15% (95% CI: 0.12-0.18%) in mainland China excluding Hubei through 1.41% (95% CI: 1.38-1.45%) in Hubei province excluding the city of Wuhan to 5.25% (95% CI: 4.98-5.51%) in Wuhan.

Moreover, no primary prophylaxis measures (vaccination) nor effective treatments are available. If the above represented percentages are applied to the worldwide populations, it appears clear why any measure should be considered to avoid a further diffusion of the virus and prevent the saturation and collapse of health systems and the most catastrophic pandemic since 1919 Spanish flu. Isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen, which is presumed through respiratory droplets. A 14 days quarantine is applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who had contact with confirmed cases. It is assumed that, if in this period the subject does not develop any sign or symptoms compatible with COVID-19, he is not infected and thus the quarantine can be removed, and the subject returned to the community. Domiciliary quarantine of 14 days since a positive test is applied also for patients with a diagnosed mild disease who did not need medical support. These rules are effective in controlling infections in the community, but several doubts arise when it is necessary to transpose them in the hospital setting. Hospitals are indeed a delicate place in epidemics: they collect fragile persons who can be exposed to the virus and are subsequently readmitted to the community thus spreading the infection. Indeed, the ongoing outbreak in Northern Italy has been linked to a single infected patient who accessed to a community hospital where he transmitted the virus to several other patients and health-care operators.[6] Moreover, the isolation of patients in the hospital setting impose a significant burden in terms of PPE used by the health-care operators, space dedicated and time employed in their management. Even more complex is the situation of patients in ICU, where viral spreading is facilitated by endotracheal tubes and manoeuvres performed on the respiratory tract. Therefore, a clear definition of the infectiousness timing and intensity of viral spreading is mandatory to alleviate the burden on the health-care system. Unfortunately, the data available on the topic are scarce and composed only of measurements of viral shedding, without an assessment of the infectivity. Kim et al.[7] assessed the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory tract materials in the first two confirmed patients in Korea. They employed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and converted cycle threshold (CT) values of rRT-PCR into RNA copy number. The detection limit of rRT-PCR was 2,690 copies/mL. Overall, viral load above detection limit was detected until 14 and 25 days after symptoms onset and for 13 and 11 days after the first detection, respectively.[7] Of note, both patients received treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. Instead, Zou and colleagues analysed viral load in repeated nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients.[8] They also employed rRT-PCR and considered a CT of 40 as detection limit. Higher viral loads were observed in nasal swabs and in samples collected soon after symptoms onset. Overall, only two patients prese ted positive samples, and only in nasal swab, 14 days after symptoms onset, and with low viral load. In conclusion, a larger amount of data about duration of viral spreading and infectivity in hospitalized patients, especially in ICU, is badly needed to better define quarantine period and avoid nosocomial transmission. Before their availability, the canonical 14 days period of quarantine should be respected.","","False","Journal of Hospital Infection","December 2019|Chinese|2|Chinese|82,297|2,804|26th|3-5 days|80%|15%|5%|ICU).[4|between 0.4% and 2.9%|1919|Spanish|PPE|14 days|14 days|Northern Italy|PPE|ICU|Kim|first|two|Korea|CT|RNA|2,690|14 and 25 days|13|11 days|first|Zou|17|40|two|14 days|ICU|14 days","els-covid","#5464","","","DATE|NORP|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERCENT|NORP|PERCENT|DATE|NORP|ORG|DATE|DATE|LOC|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|DATE","Elsevier","2020-03-06","3005788786","10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.003","custom_license"

AIM: We investigated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza and the impact of repeated vaccination over 10 previous seasons on current season VE among older adults. METHODS: We conducted an observational test-negative study in community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years in Ontario, Canada for the 2010/11 to 2015/16 seasons by linking laboratory and health administrative data. We estimated VE using multivariable logistic regression. We assessed the impact of repeated vaccination by stratifying by previous vaccination history. RESULTS: We included 58,304 testing episodes for respiratory viruses, with 11,496 (20%) testing positive for influenza and 31,004 (53%) vaccinated. Adjusted VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for the six seasons combined was 21% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18 to 24%). Patients who were vaccinated in the current season, but had received no vaccinations in the previous 10 seasons, had higher current season VE (34%; 95%CI: 9 to 52%) than patients who had received 1–3 (26%; 95%CI: 13 to 37%), 4–6 (24%; 95%CI: 15 to 33%), 7–8 (13%; 95%CI: 2 to 22%), or 9–10 (7%; 95%CI: −4 to 16%) vaccinations (trend test p = 0.001). All estimates were higher after correcting for misclassification of current season vaccination status. For patients who were not vaccinated in the current season, residual protection rose significantly with increasing numbers of vaccinations received previously. CONCLUSIONS: Although VE appeared to decrease with increasing numbers of previous vaccinations, current season vaccination likely provides some protection against influenza regardless of the number of vaccinations received over the previous 10 influenza seasons.","20317b47f1178792d735b4202fc343721d1ff4a5","True","Euro Surveill","Annual|VE|10 previous seasons|VE|65 years|Ontario|Canada|the 2010/11 to 2015/16 seasons|VE|58,304|11,496|20%|31,004|53%|the six seasons|21%|95%|CI|18|24%|the current season|the previous 10 seasons|VE|34%|95%CI|9 to 52%|1–3|26%|95%CI|13|37%|4–6|24%|95%CI|15 to 33%|7–8|13%|95%CI|2 to 22%|9–10|7%|16%|0.001|current season|the current season|VE|the previous 10","cc-by","","PMC6961264","31937397","DATE|ORG|DATE|ORG|DATE|GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|PERCENT|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|DATE","PMC","2020 Jan 9","","10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.1.1900245","comm_use_subset"

Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Findings Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients. Interpretation The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.

Regulatory element activity is in turn modulated by genetic variation, resulting in variable transcription rates across individuals. The interplay of these factors, however, is poorly understood. Here we characterize expression and chromatin state dynamics across three tissues—liver, lung, and kidney—in 47 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population, examining the regulation of these dynamics by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin QTL (cQTL). QTL whose allelic effects were consistent across tissues were detected for 1,101 genes and 133 chromatin regions. Also detected were eQTL and cQTL whose allelic effects differed across tissues, including local-eQTL for Pik3c2g detected in all three tissues but with distinct allelic effects. Leveraging overlapping measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility on the same mice from multiple tissues, we used mediation analysis to identify chromatin and gene expression intermediates of eQTL effects. Based on QTL and mediation analyses over multiple tissues, we propose a causal model for the distal genetic regulation of Akr1e1, a gene involved in glycogen metabolism, through the zinc finger transcription factor Zfp985 and chromatin intermediates. This analysis demonstrates the complexity of transcriptional and chromatin dynamics and their regulation over multiple tissues, as well as the value of the CC and related genetic resource populations for identifying specific regulatory mechanisms within cells and tissues.","c7d1c17055c7320e8d2a0cca313bddc7dcb3d401; ae8b139ede9460926a290fbae525b59fbe0e5c53; 1029b20dd40ca982d05b80adad4c125beb10217b","True","PLoS Genet","three|47|the Collaborative Cross (CC|QTL|QTL|1,101|133|three|QTL|Zfp985|CC","cc-by","","PMC7010298","31961859","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 21","","10.1371/journal.pgen.1008537","comm_use_subset"

Recently, there has been a focus on the cannabinoid Cannabidiol (CBD) and its potential benefits. This study investigated the safety of a proprietary extract of C. sativa, consisting of 9% hemp extract (of which 6.27% is CBD) and 91% olive oil. The mutagenic potential of the hemp extract was evaluated with the AMES assay inclusive of a hepatic drug metabolizing mix (S9) rich in CYP enzymes. The test article did not elicit evidence of bacterial mutagenicity. GLP compliant 14-day and a 90-day toxicity study were conducted. Olive oil was used as a control. The 90-day study had a 28-day recovery period. Treatments for the 14-day non-recovery range-finding study were 0, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg test article/kg body weight (bw)/day for 14 days. There was a non-statistically significant (p > 0.05) decrease in body weights for the male and female rats receiving the test article. Hypoactivity, hyperactivity, reduced food consumption and piloerection were observed in the rats receiving 4000 mg test article/kg bw. Histopathology showed an increase in the size of liver cells (hypertrophy) around the central vein (centrilobular) in Groups 3 (3/10) and 4 (5/10) that correlated with increased liver weights. In the 90-day study, 8 groups of rats were dosed with 0, 200, 400 and 800 mg test article/kg bw/day. Groups 5 to 8 had a 28-day recovery. There were no test article-linked changes in clinical observations, physical examinations, Functional Observation Battery, ophthalmology, Motor Activity Assessment, hematology, clinical chemistries and macropathology (all groups). With the exception of the liver and adrenal gland, no test article-linked pathology was observed. For all rats receiving the test article, histopathology showed hypertrophy of liver cells around the central vein. The increase of liver weight is most likely caused by hypertrophy due to up-regulation of the hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes. The hepatocellular hypertrophy was completely reversed in 28 days and was not considered to be an adverse effect. Vacuolization of the adrenal zona fasciculata was observed in the control and 800 mg test article/kg bw groups. The vacuolization of the zona fasciculata was of the same incidence and severity in treatment and control male rats and correlated with an increased in the weights of the adrenal glands. In addition, a statistically significant increase (p<0.05) in adrenal-to-body weight ratios was observed for females receiving 800 mg test article/kg bw. This increase in adrenal-to-body weight ratio did not correlate with any of the pathology findings. The NOAEL for the test article is 800 mg/kg bw/day for female and 400 mg/kg bw/day for male Sprague Dawley rats.","140ab046d55c6618aa71fea9e48b7971a7e4b60e; 7bfc2c373683e0a176cb061bc890ca097ce55d60","True","Toxicol Rep","Cannabinoids|Cannabis|L.|Cannabidiol|CBD|C.|9%|6.27%|CBD|91%|AMES|CYP|14-day|90-day|90-day|28-day|14-day|0|1000|2000|4000|14 days|0.05|4000|Groups|3|3/10|4|5/10|90-day|8|0|200|400|800|5|28-day|Functional Observation Battery|Motor Activity Assessment|28 days|800|800|NOAEL|800|400|Sprague Dawley","cc-by-nc-nd","","PMC7036713","32123668","ORG|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|ORG|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON","PMC","2020 Feb 20","","10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.02.014","noncomm_use_subset"

As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic information systems and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics.","","False","Int J Health Geogr","December 2019|Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV’|Wuhan|Hubei Province|China|China|China|Hubei|CoV|2002/2003|GIS|2019/2020|one|China|GIS","cc-by","#7552","PMC7065369","32160889","DATE|WORK_OF_ART|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|DATE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE","PMC_new","2020-03-11","","10.1186/s12942-020-00202-8",""

Regulation of these functions remains poorly understood but could be mediated by functionally specialized pDC subpopulations. We address pDC diversity using a high-dimensional single-cell approach: mass cytometry (CyTOF). Our analysis uncovers a murine pDC-like population that specializes in antigen presentation with limited capacity for IFN-I production. Using a multifaceted cross-species comparison, we show that this pDC-like population is the definitive murine equivalent of the recently described human AXL(+) DCs, which we unify under the name transitional DCs (tDCs) given their continuum of pDC and cDC2 characteristics. tDCs share developmental traits with pDCs, as well as recruitment dynamics during viral infection.

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. Methods Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.","ab728ce93b594b824d9c8b832637496f8649157a","True","Infection, Genetics and Evolution","2019-nCoV|Wuhan|China|2019-nCoV|Bayesian|2019-nCoV|BatCoV|96.3%|first|11,498|3′-part|24,341–30,696|2019-nCoV|RaTG13|ORF1b|almost half|2019-nCoV|2019-nCoV|RaTG13|2019-nCoV|2019-nCov|almost half","els-covid","#41","","32004758","CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|NORP|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-04-30","3003223635","10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104212","custom_license"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey assessing self-reported compliance and its behavioural correlates. SETTING: Internships of medical students in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 322 medical students of the Erasmus Medical Center were recruited over a period of 12 months during the Public Health internship, which is the final compulsory internship after an 18-month rotation schedule in all major specialities. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Behavioural factors influencing compliance to hand hygiene guidelines were measured by means of a questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Social Ecological Models. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the effect of including attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, knowledge, risk perception and habit on hand hygiene compliance. RESULTS: We included 313 students in the analysis (response rate 97%). The behavioural model explained 40% of the variance in self-reported compliance (adjusted R(2)=0.40). Hand hygiene compliance was strongly influenced by attitudes (perceived outcomes of preventive actions), self-efficacy (perception of the ability to perform hand hygiene at the clinical ward) and habit, but was not associated with knowledge and risk perception. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting medical students’ behaviour should focus on the empowerment of these juniors and provide them with evidence on the health benefits of prevention, rather than increasing their factual knowledge of procedures.

More attention should be paid to comorbidities in the treatment of COVID-19. In the literature, COVID-19 is characterised by the symptoms of viral pneumonia such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, and lymphopenia. Many of the older patients who become severely ill have evidence of underlying illness such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, kidney disease, or malignant tumours.3, 4, 5 These patients often die of their original comorbidities; we therefore need to accurately evaluate all original comorbidities of individuals with COVID-19. In addition to the risk of group transmission of an infectious disease, we should pay full attention to the treatment of the original comorbidities of the individual while treating pneumonia, especially in older patients with serious comorbid conditions.

Basic treatments were provided, such as antivirals, antibiotics, oxygen therapy, and glucocorticoids. 33 (55%) of 60 patients were type B, with disease that manifested with different degrees of pneumonia, accompanied by serious comorbidities. For patients classified as type B, we continued to monitor the changes of comorbidities while managing the pneumonia, carrying out individual evaluations and developing specific treatment plans, including antihypertensives, hypoglycaemic therapy, and continuous renal replacement therapy. 14 (23%) of 60 patients were critically ill and were classified as type C. Patients classified as type C had disease that was considered to have developed from the aggravation of disease seen either in type A or type B, when early therapeutic effects for type A disease were unsatisfactory (resulting in multiple organ injuries), or when disease associated with type B became aggravated and the patient's condition deteriorated from their original comorbidities (leading to multiple organ failure). Attention should be paid to organ function in these critically ill patients and necessary protective measures, including mechanical ventilation, glucocorticoids, antivirals, symptomatic treatments, and anti-shock therapy. We believe that the classification of COVID-19 in severe patients could help in individual evaluation of the disease and would provide effective triage for the treatment and management of individual patients.

"Robson, B.","Computers and viral diseases. Preliminary bioinformatics studies on the design of a synthetic vaccine and a preventative peptidomimetic antagonist against the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV, COVID-19) coronavirus","Abstract This paper concerns study of the genome of the Wuhan Seafood Market isolate believed to represent the causative agent of the disease COVID-19. This is to find a short section or sections of viral protein sequence suitable for preliminary design proposal for a peptide synthetic vaccine and a peptidomimetic therapeutic, and to explore some design possibilities. The project was originally directed towards a use case for the Q-UEL language and its implementation in a knowledge management and automated inference system for medicine called the BioIngine, but focus here remains mostly on the virus itself. However, using Q-UEL systems to access relevant and emerging literature, and to interact with standard publically available bioinformatics tools on the Internet, did help quickly identify sequences of amino acids that are well conserved across many coronaviruses including 2019-nCoV. KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well conserved in this study and corresponds to the region around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus that are believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. This sequence motif and surrounding variations formed the basis for proposing a specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent. The work can, nonetheless, be described in traditional bioinformatics terms, and readily reproduced by others, albeit with the caveat that new data and research into 2019-nCoV is emerging and evolving at an explosive pace. Preliminary studies using molecular modeling and docking, and in that context the potential value of certain known herbal extracts, are also described.","fea50730d7cdcd7c728f98c31fe20aeb8af5e350","True","Computers in Biology and Medicine","the Wuhan Seafood Market|COVID-19|BioIngine|2019-nCoV.|KRSFIEDLLFNKV|2019-nCoV","els-covid","#1938","","","ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-02-26","1655564745","10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103670","custom_license"

MERS-CoV is transmitted sporadically from dromedary camels to humans and occasionally through human-to-human contact. Current epidemiologic evidence supports a major role in transmission for direct contact with live camels or humans with symptomatic MERS, but little evidence suggests the possibility of transmission from camel products or asymptomatic MERS cases. Because a proportion of case-patients do not report direct contact with camels or with persons who have symptomatic MERS, further research is needed to conclusively determine additional mechanisms of transmission, to inform public health practice, and to refine current precautionary recommendations.","791e42babcf7e8b6edf94918b034f15ce32ec402","True","Emerg Infect Dis","Middle East|CoV","no-cc","","PMC6986839","31961300","LOC|PERSON","PMC","2020 Feb","","10.3201/eid2602.190697","custom_license"
"Anderson, Roy M; Heesterbeek, Hans; Klinkenberg, Don; Hollingsworth, T Déirdre","How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?","What has happened in China shows that quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic.1 This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is encouraging for the many countries where COVID-19 is beginning to spread. However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002–03, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or more precisely the area under the epidemic curve. For an epidemic to take hold, the value of R0 must be greater than unity in value. A simple calculation gives the fraction likely to be infected without mitigation. This fraction is roughly 1–1/R0. With R0 values for COVID-19 in China around 2·5 in the early stages of the epidemic,2 we calculate that approximately 60% of the population would become infected. This is a very worst-case scenario for a number of reasons. We are uncertain about transmission in children, some communities are remote and unlikely to be exposed, voluntary social distancing by individuals and communities will have an impact, and mitigation efforts, such as the measures put in place in China, greatly reduce transmission. As an epidemic progresses, the effective reproduction number (R) declines until it falls below unity in value when the epidemic peaks and then decays, either due to the exhaustion of people susceptible to infection or the impact of control measures.","882219fd09765ece5b362415882397e78972373e","True","The Lancet","China|China|COVID-19|China|Singapore|Hong Kong|2002–03|COVID-19|COVID-19|R0|one|1–1/R0|R0|COVID-19|China|epidemic,2|approximately 60%|China","els-covid","#5572","","","GPE|GPE|PERSON|GPE|GPE|GPE|GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|PERCENT|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-09","","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30567-5","custom_license"
"Tetro, Jason A.","Is COVID-19 receiving ADE from other coronaviruses?","Abstract One of the most perplexing questions regarding the current COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic is the discrepancy between the severity of cases observed in the Hubei province of China and those occurring elsewhere in the world. One possible answer is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses. ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and deaths.","f48986254b981e602475cd421c586b5bce8dda4c","True","Microbes and Infection","One|COVID-19|Hubei|China|One|ADE|ADE|one|ADE","els-covid","#1484","","32092539","CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-31","3006338236","10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.006","custom_license"

We identified a group of approved drugs that could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells (appendix). The drug targets are members of the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family—including AAK1 and GAK—the inhibition of which has been shown to reduce viral infection in vitro. Baricitinib was identified as a NAK inhibitor, with a particularly high affinity for AAK1, a pivotal regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Intensive effort has been implemented for the treatment of ZIKV, however there are not currently approved vaccines or antivirals available to combat ZIKV infection. In this sense, the identification of virulence factors associated with changes in ZIKV virulence could help to develop safe and effective countermeasures to treat ZIKV or to prevent future outbreaks. Here, we have compared the virulence of two related ZIKV strains from the recent outbreak in Brazil (2015), Rio Grande do Norte Natal (RGN) and Paraiba. In spite of both viruses being identified in the same period of time and region, significant differences in virulence and replication were observed using a validated mouse model of ZIKV infection. While ZIKV-RGN has a 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD(50)) of ~10(5) focus forming units (FFUs), ZIKV-Paraiba infection resulted in 100% of lethality with less than 10 FFUs. Combining deep-sequencing analysis and our previously described infectious ZIKV-RGN cDNA clone, we identified a natural polymorphism in the non-structural protein 2 A (NS2A) that increase the virulence of ZIKV. Moreover, results demonstrate that the single amino acid alanine to valine substitution at position 117 (A117V) in the NS2A was sufficient to convert the attenuated rZIKV-RGN in a virulent Paraiba-like virus (MLD(50) < 10 FFU). The mechanism of action was also evaluated and data indicate that substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A protein reduces host innate immune responses and viral-induced apoptosis in vitro. Therefore, amino acid substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A could be used as a genetic risk-assessment marker for future ZIKV outbreaks.","a72473db86f1e26d0d1e6db3e7078a3536b9ba65","True","Sci Rep","ZIKV|one|ZIKV|ZIKV|ZIKV|ZIKV|two|ZIKV|Brazil|2015|Rio Grande|Norte Natal|Paraiba|ZIKV|ZIKV-RGN|50%|ZIKV-|100%|less than 10|Combining|ZIKV-RGN|2|ZIKV|117|Paraiba|10|FFU|ZIKV|ZIKV|ZIKV","cc-by","","PMC6934710","31882898","PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|DATE|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON","PMC","2019 Dec 27","","10.1038/s41598-019-56291-4","comm_use_subset"

The virus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is in the species SARS-like corona viruses. At 125 nm, it is slightly larger than influenza, SARS and MERS viruses. It is almost certainly a descendant from a bat corona virus of which there are many. The closest is a virus that originated from the Rhinolophus bat which is > 96% homologous with the current SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is only 79% homologous with the original SARS CoV [1]. The near identical gene sequences of 90 analysed cases from outside of China suggests it has likely emerged after a solitary species jump in early December 2019 from an unknown (likely mammalian) intermediate host [2]. Pangolins are an endangered ant-eating mammal from which scientists in Guangzhou have shown a coronavirus with 99% homology, with a receptor binding domain identical to that of SARS-CoV-2. However, this has not been confirmed, and, in addition, the pangolin's rarity means this may not be the only mammal involved.","78360444f3b4540339efc9e7e5f2610a7e46c023","True","BMC Med","COVID-19|COVID-19|125|Rhinolophus|96%|only 79%|CoV|1|90|China|early December 2019|2|Pangolins|Guangzhou|99%","cc-by","#2807","PMC7047369","32106852","PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|PERCENT","PMC","2020 Feb 28","3005943294","10.1186/s12916-020-01533-w","comm_use_subset"

Some sleep-improving drugs may inhibit the respiratory system and worsen the condition. Prolonged bedside instruction may increase the risk of medical infections. Objective To investigate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety and sleep quality of COVID-19. Methods In this randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 51 patients who entered the isolation ward were included in the study and randomly divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group used progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) technology for 30 min per day for 5 consecutive days. During this period, the control group received only routine care and treatment. Before and after the intervention, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) and Sleep State Self-Rating Scale (SRSS) were used to measure and record patient anxiety and sleep quality. Finally, data analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0 software. Results The average anxiety score (STAI) before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.730), and the average anxiety score after intervention was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The average sleep quality score (SRSS) of the two groups before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.838), and it was statistically significant after intervention (P < 0.001).

"De Luca, Daniele","Managing neonates with respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2","In their Comment in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, Jianhui Wang and colleagues1 suggested a plan to handle neonates with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). This is a timely reflection, given the public health problem represented by this infection and the need to anticipate any critical care issue, irrespective of patients' ages. However, the plan is incomplete or unsuitable in many points. We do not know anything about neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections, and we must reasonably follow data from adult critical care.

To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these human coronavirus infections. Intensive research on the novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate their route of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential drug targets, which would promote the development of effective preventive and therapeutic countermeasures.

Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.","e99007872c680946a21f1044fa9d9170680a42f9","True","The Lancet","Summary|December, 2019|Review of|three|3166|24|Review","els-covid","#2354","","","GPE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-20","3006659024","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8","custom_license"

However, in-depth analysis of these data show clear disparities in mortality rates between Wuhan (>3%), different regions of Hubei (about 2·9% on average), and across the other provinces of China (about 0·7% on average). We postulate that this is likely to be related to the rapid escalation in the number of infections around the epicentre of the outbreak, which has resulted in an insufficiency of health-care resources, thereby negatively affecting patient outcomes in Hubei, while this has not yet been the situation for the other parts of China (figure A, B). If we assume that average levels of health care are similar throughout China, higher numbers of infections in a given population can be considered an indirect indicator of a heavier health-care burden. Plotting mortality against the incidence of COVID-19 (cumulative number of confirmed cases since the start of the outbreak, per 10 000 population) showed a significant positive correlation (figure C), suggesting that mortality is correlated with health-care burden.","","False","The Lancet Global Health","the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention|China|CDC|Feb 16, 2020|70 641|1772|COVID-19|about 2·5%|Wuhan|3%|Hubei|2·9%|China|about 0·7%|Hubei|China|China|COVID-19|10","cc-by-nc-nd","#1979","","","ORG|GPE|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|GPE|GPE|GPE|PERSON|CARDINAL","CZI","2020-02-25","2343822881","10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30068-1","noncomm_use_subset"

Supporting the recommendation of the authors, I would like to add some points in relation to the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation in patients with COVID-19 infection: First, although exhaled air dispersion during high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation via different interfaces is restricted, provided that there is a good mask interface fitting,4 not all hospitals around the world have access to such interfaces or enough personal-protective equipment of sufficiently high quality (ie, considered fit-tested particulate respirators, N95 or equivalent, or higher level of protection) for aerosol-generating procedures, and several hospitals do not have a negative pressure isolation room.

While virus-host interactions are promising targets for antivirals, there is only limited knowledge regarding the interactions of EBOV with cellular host factors. Recently, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen that identified the nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) as an important host factor for the EBOV life cycle. NXF1 is a major component of the nuclear mRNA export pathway that is usurped by many viruses whose life cycles include nuclear stages. However, the role of NXF1 in the life cycle of EBOV, a virus replicating in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, remains unknown. In order to better understand the role of NXF1 in the EBOV life cycle, we performed a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and double immunofluorescence assays to characterize the interactions of NXF1 with viral proteins and RNAs. Additionally, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of NXF1 together with functional assays, we analyzed the role of NXF1 in individual aspects of the virus life cycle. With this approach we identified the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) as a viral interaction partner of NXF1. Further studies revealed that NP interacts with the RNA-binding domain of NXF1 and competes with RNA for this interaction. Co-localization studies showed that RNA binding-deficient, but not wildtype NXF1, accumulates in NP-derived inclusion bodies, and knockdown experiments demonstrated that NXF1 is necessary for viral protein expression, but not for viral RNA synthesis. Finally, our results showed that NXF1 interacts with viral mRNAs, but not with viral genomic RNAs. Based on these results we suggest a model whereby NXF1 is recruited into inclusion bodies to promote the export of viral mRNA:NXF1 complexes from these sites. This would represent a novel function for NXF1 in the life cycle of cytoplasmically replicating viruses, and may provide a basis for new therapeutic approaches against EBOV, and possibly other emerging viruses.","a068f1ec98befb3d767ba602df5f314604f0aee8","True","Cells","EBOV|siRNA|RNA|1|NXF1|NXF1|EBOV|NXF1|NXF1|NXF1|NXF1|EBOV|NP|NXF1|NP|RNA|NXF1|RNA|RNA|NP|NXF1|RNA|mRNAs|NXF1|NXF1","cc-by","","PMC7017048","31940815","GPE|PRODUCT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL","PMC","2020 Jan 11","","10.3390/cells9010187","comm_use_subset"

We planned a prospective cohort study to determine the impact of ARI during infancy on the pulmonary function test indices at 3 years of age. METHODS: A cohort of normal, full-term newborns were followed up 6 monthly and during ARI episodes. Infant pulmonary function tests (IPFTs) were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit using tidal breathing flow-volume loop, rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RTC) and raised volume RTC manoeuvres. During each ARI episode, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR. RESULTS: We screened 3421 neonates; 310 were enrolled; IPFT was performed in 225 (boys: 125 (55.6%)) at 3 years. During infancy, 470 ARI episodes were documented in 173 infants. At 3 years, children with history of any ARI episode during infancy had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1.0)), forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s (FEV(0.75)), forced expiratory volume in 0.5 s (FEV(0.5)), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF(25–75)), and maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC (MEF(25)) as compared with those without any ARI episode during infancy. The ratio of tidal expiratory flow (TEF) at 25% or 50% of tidal expiratory volume to peak TEF (TEF(50) or TEF(25)/peak TEF) at 3 years was significantly increased in children who had ARI in infancy. CONCLUSIONS: ARI during infancy is associated with impaired pulmonary function indices such as increased resistance and decreased forced expiratory flow and volume at 3 years of age.","b399adcfb1d563f2c836e2c924fb0c090fca961a","True","BMJ Open Respir Res","ARI|at 3 years of age|METHODS|6|monthly|ARI|RTC|RTC|ARI|3421|310|225|125|55.6%|3 years|470|ARI|173|3 years|1 s|FEV(1.0|0.75|0.5 s|FEV(0.5|between 25% and 75%|FVC|25%|FVC|ARI|25% or 50%|3 years|ARI|3 years of age","cc-by-nc","","PMC7047475","32079606","ORG|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|QUANTITY|PERSON|CARDINAL|QUANTITY|PERSON|PERCENT|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|DATE","PMC","2020 Feb 19","","10.1136/bmjresp-2019-000436","noncomm_use_subset"
"Cai, Hua","Sex difference and smoking predisposition in patients with COVID-19","The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is quickly turning into a pandemic. Although the disease is now better contained in China, 32 702 cases remain as of March 2, 2020. 10 566 cases and 166 deaths outside of China had been reported as of March 3 (WHO situation report 43), which is a large increase from the 2918 cases and 44 deaths reported on Feb 26 (WHO situation report 37). Rapid progress has been made with diagnostic reagents (eg, nucleic acid and IgM or IgG detection, or both), drug repurposing (eg, remdesivir and chloroquine), and vaccine production. Studies on the biology of viral infection and clinical management of the disease have also been published, some of which have demonstrated that differences in COVID-19 disease prevalence and severity are associated with sex, and smoking is related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), so that might also be a factor. One study (preprint),1 using single-cell sequencing, found that expression of ACE2 was more predominant in Asian men, which might be the reason for the higher prevalence of COVID-19 in this subgroup of patients than in women and patients of other ethnicities. One study of 140 patients with COVID-19 in China,2 found the sex distribution equal; whereas, in a study of critically ill patients,3 more men were affected (67%) than women. In a latest report4 of 1099 patients with COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces in China, 58% of the patients were men. Taken together, these data seem to indicate that there might be a sex predisposition to COVID-19, with men more prone to being affected. This sex predisposition might be associated with the much higher smoking rate in men than in women in China (288 million men vs 12·6 million women were smokers in 2018). Of note, one study (preprint)5 found that although ACE2 expression was not significantly different between Asian and white people, men and women, or subgroups aged older and younger than 60 years, it was significantly higher in current smokers of Asian ethnicity than Asian non-smokers; although no difference was found between smokers and non-smokers who were white. Nonetheless, the current literature does not support smoking as a predisposing factor in men or any subgroup for infection with SARS-CoV-2. In the study by Zhang and colleagues,2 only 1·4% of patients were current smokers, although this number was much higher at 12·6% in the study by Guan and colleagues.4 The relatively small proportion of current smokers in each of these two studies compared with the proportion of male smokers in China (50·5%) are unlikely to be associated with incidence or severity of COVID-19. A trend towards an association was seen between smoking and severity of COVID-19 in the study by Zhang and colleagues2 (11·8% of smokers had non-severe disease vs 16·9% of smokers with severe disease), but it was not significant. Without strong evidence of an association between smoking and prevalence or severity of COVID-19 in Asian men compared with other subgroups, no firm conclusions can be drawn. With more cases being examined from different ethnic and genetic backgrounds worldwide, ACE2 expression variation can be better analysed and compared to establish whether it contributes to susceptibility to COVID-19 across the different subgroups.","a946582580b10f59b7267ae8e6e312a08fe90552","True","The Lancet Respiratory Medicine","2019|COVID-19|China|32 702|March 2, 2020|10 566|166|China|March 3|43|2918|44|Feb 26|37|IgM|IgG|ACE2|2|One|ACE2|Asian|COVID-19|One|140|China,2|67%|1099|COVID-19|552|30|China|58%|COVID-19|China|288 million|12·6 million|2018|one|preprint)5|Asian|60 years|Asian|Asian|Zhang|colleagues,2|only 1·4%|12·6%|Guan|two|China|50·5%|COVID-19|COVID-19|Zhang|11·8%|16·9%|COVID-19|Asian","els-covid","#7486","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|NORP|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|NORP|DATE|NORP|NORP|PERSON|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|PERSON|CARDINAL|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERSON|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|NORP","Elsevier","2020-03-11","","10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30117-X","custom_license"

"Bermejo-Martin, Jesús F; Almansa, Raquel; Menéndez, Rosario; Mendez, Raúl; Kelvin, David J; Torres, Antoni","Lymphopenic community acquired pneumonia as signature of severe COVID-19 infection","In two recent articles from Huang C et al and Yang X in The Lancet,2,3 85% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 showed lymphopenia. The presence of lymphopenia as a signature of severe COVID-19 was confirmed by Wang D et al, who, in their study published in JAMA, reported that ICU patients suffering this infection had a median lymphocyte count of 800 cells/mm,3 with non survivors exhibiting persistent lymphopenia.4 ICU patients present also with high levels of plasma cytokines.2 The existence of hyper-cytokinemia in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia could indicate a poor control of the pathogen, as showed in severe patients infected with the 2009 Pandemic Influenza virus. Interestingly, hypercytokinemia and lymphopenia were also evident in critical patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome due to the Coronavirus emerged in 2003 (SARS-CoV).5,6 These features (lymphopenia + hypercytokinemia) fit the characteristics of a particular immunological phenotype of community acquired pneumonia (CAP), lymphopenic CAP (L-CAP), which, as we recently demonstrated in an article published in the Journal of Infection, is associated with increased severity, mortality and a dysregulated immunological response.7 In their works, Yang X et al and Chen N et al propose a direct cytotoxic action of the virus to explain the low lymphocyte counts observed in the severe cases of COVID-19.3,8 But, in our opinion, host factors could also contribute to induce lymphopenia in these cases. Compared with those patients not requiring intensive care, COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU are older and are more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.4 Aging and chronic diseases induce chronic endothelial dysfunction. As we recently reviewed in J Clin Med, endothelial dysfunction induces disassembly of intercellular junctions, endothelial cell death and blood-tissue barrier disruption, along with enhanced leukocyte adhesion and extravasation, which could contribute to explain the lymphopenia observed in severe COVID-19 patients.9 Recent findings from our group have evidenced the interconnection between lymphopenia and endothelial dysfunction in patients with CAP and organ failure.10 Endothelial dysfunction induces also increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, glycocalyx degradation and shedding along with a pro-coagulant and anti-fibrinolytic state.9 In aged individuals with chronic diseases, these features could represent predisposing factors for presenting a severe respiratory failure following COVID-19 infection.","2653807613a9f41dd55b66dcd5d5b551f7e29e9b","True","Journal of Infection","two|Huang C et al|Yang X|Lancet,2,3|85%|COVID-19|Wang D et al|JAMA|ICU|800|COVID-19|2009|Influenza|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|Coronavirus|2003|SARS-CoV).5,6 These|CAP|CAP|the Journal of Infection|Yang X|al|Chen N|COVID-19.3,8|ICU|Clin Med|CAP","els-covid","#3547","","","CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|DATE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-05","2953538649","10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.029","custom_license"

John Zarocostas reports from WHO is leading the effort to slow the spread of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. But a global epidemic of misinformation—spreading rapidly through social media platforms and other outlets—poses a serious problem for public health. “We’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an infodemic”, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on Feb 15. Immediately after COVID-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, WHO's risk communication team launched a new information platform called WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN), with the aim of using a series of amplifiers to share tailored information with specific target groups. Sylvie Briand, director of Infectious Hazards Management at WHO's Health Emergencies Programme and architect of WHO's strategy to counter the infodemic risk, told The Lancet, “We know that every outbreak will be accompanied by a kind of tsunami of information, but also within this information you always have misinformation, rumours, etc. We know that even in the Middle Ages there was this phenomenon”. “But the difference now with social media is that this phenomenon is amplified, it goes faster and further, like the viruses that travel with people and go faster and further. So it is a new challenge, and the challenge is the [timing] because you need to be faster if you want to fill the void…What is at stake during an outbreak is making sure people will do the right thing to control the disease or to mitigate its impact. So it is not only information to make sure people are informed; it is also making sure people are informed to act appropriately.” About 20 staff and some consultants are involved in WHO's communications teams globally, at any given time. This includes social media personnel at each of WHO's six regional offices, risk communications consultants, and WHO communications officers.","","False","The Lancet","WHO|COVID-19|John Zarocostas|WHO|2019|WHO|the Munich Security Conference|Feb 15|COVID-19|International Concern|WHO|WHO Information Network for Epidemics|EPI-WIN|Sylvie Briand|Infectious Hazards Management|WHO's|Health Emergencies Programme|WHO|Lancet|the Middle Ages|About 20|WHO|WHO|six","els-covid","#3015","","32113495","ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|DATE|ORG|EVENT|DATE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-06","2799474450","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30461-X","custom_license"
"Sheikh, Abdullah; Al-Taher, Abdulla; Al-Nazawi, Mohammed; Al-Mubarak, Abdullah I.; Kandeel, Mahmoud","Analysis of preferred codon usage in the coronavirus N genes and their implications for genome evolution and vaccine design","Abstract The nucleocapsid (N) protein of a coronavirus plays a crucial role in virus assembly and in its RNA transcription. It is important to characterize a virus at the nucleotide level to discover the virus’s genomic sequence variations and similarities relative to other viruses that could have an impact on the functions of its genes and proteins. This entails a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the viral genomes of interest for preferred nucleotides, codon bias, nucleotide changes at the 3rd position (NT3s), synonymous codon usage and relative synonymous codon usage. In this study, the variations in the N proteins among 13 different coronaviruses (CoVs) were analysed at the nucleotide and amino acid levels in an attempt to reveal how these viruses adapt to their hosts relative to their preferred codon usage in the N genes. The results revealed that, overall, eighteen amino acids had different preferred codons and eight of these were over-biased. The N genes had a higher AT% over GC% and the values of their effective number of codons ranged from 40.43 to 53.85, indicating a slight codon bias. Neutrality plots and correlation analyses showed a very high level of GC3s/GC correlation in porcine epidemic diarrhea CoV (pedCoV), followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS CoV), porcine delta CoV (dCoV), bat CoV (bCoV) and feline CoV (fCoV) with r values 0.81, 0.68, -0.47, 0.98 and 0.58, respectively. These data implied a high rate of evolution of the CoV genomes and a strong influence of mutation on evolutionary selection in the CoV N genes.

Identifying who needs antibiotics is challenging; microbiological confirmation and clinical scores are used but have limitations. In a cross-sectional study nested within a randomized controlled trial, we estimated the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of group A Streptococcus (GAS) in patients presenting to primary care with a sore throat and fever in northern Thailand. We then evaluated the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) and clinical scores (Centor and FeverPAIN) to identify the presence of GAS. One hundred sixty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 35 (20.7%) had β-hemolytic Streptococci (BHS) isolated from throat swab culture, and 11 (6.5%) had GAS. All GAS isolates were sensitive to penicillin G. The median CRP of those without BHS isolation was 10 mg/L (interquartile range [IQR] ≤ 8–18), compared with 18 mg/L (IQR 9–71, P = 0.0302) for those with GAS and 14 mg/L (IQR ≤ 8–38, P = 0.0516) for those with any BHS isolated. However, there were no significant relationships between CRP > 8 mg/L (P = 0.112), Centor ≥ 3 (P = 0.212), and FeverPAIN ≥ 4 (P = 1.000), and the diagnosis of GAS compared with no BHS isolation. Identifying who requires antibiotics for pharyngitis remains challenging and necessitates further larger studies. C-reactive protein testing alone, although imperfect, can reduce prescribing compared with routine care. Targeted CRP testing through clinical scoring may be the most cost-effective approach to ruling out GAS infection.","3cc1733c40062f59a5d1e9c7c9fd318c8041c0a2","True","Am J Trop Med Hyg","Pharyngitis|Streptococcus|GAS|Thailand|Centor|FeverPAIN|GAS|One|hundred sixty-nine|35|20.7%|Streptococci|BHS|11|6.5%|GAS|GAS|G.|BHS|10|18|0.0302|GAS|14|≤ 8–38|0.0516|BHS|8|0.112|Centor ≥ 3|FeverPAIN|1.000|GAS|BHS|GAS","cc-by","","PMC7008346","31889507","ORG|PERSON|PERSON|GPE|GPE|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PRODUCT|PERSON|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Feb 30","","10.4269/ajtmh.19-0502","comm_use_subset"

"Xiao, Yonghong; Torok, Mili Estee","Taking the right measures to control COVID-19","First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients.5 Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations.6 Similarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value.7 Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice. Fourth, public health education must be based on scientific evidence to reduce the anxiety and distress caused by misinformation. In particular, epidemiological findings need to be reported in a timely and objective manner so that they can be accurately assessed and interpreted. The risk of transmission with brief contact (less than 15 min face-to-face contact) or infection onset after 14 days of exposure to a known infected person (the estimated maximum incubation period) is low and should not be over-exaggerated. Misinformation spreads panic among the general population and is not conducive to implementation of epidemic control measures.8 Fifth, WHO has made it clear that there are currently no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and does not recommend the use of antiviral drugs, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, or traditional Chinese medicine. Despite this, there have been reports of the use of oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, prednisone, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.9 Care should be taken to not give patients drugs of unknown efficacy, which might be detrimental to critically ill patients with COVID-19; clinical trials are urgently required in this context.10 Likewise, the development of a vaccine is an urgent public health priority.","faf3ed3d6fc359c1f310e32061e5ed414fee7017","True","The Lancet Infectious Diseases","First|COVID-19|4 Second|COVID-19|N95|Third|COVID-19|COVID-19|China|Chinese|WHO International Health|Fourth|less than 15|14 days|Misinformation|Fifth|WHO|COVID-19|Chinese|Chinese|COVID-19.9 Care|COVID-19","els-covid","#4397","","","ORDINAL|ORG|TIME|ORG|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|NORP|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|NORP|NORP|ORG|ORG","Elsevier","2020-03-05","3006007867","10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30152-3","custom_license"

Since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976, the only available treatments have been medical support or the emergency administration of experimental drugs. The absence of licensed vaccines and drugs against the Ebola virus impedes the prevention of viral infection. In this study, we generated recombinant baculoviruses (rBV) expressing the Sudan virus (SUDV) matrix structural protein (VP40) (rBV-VP40-VP40) or the SUDV glycoprotein (GP) (rBV-GP-GP), and SUDV virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced by co-infection of Sf9 cells with rBV-SUDV-VP40 and rBV-SUDV-GP. The expression of SUDV VP40 and GP in SUDV VLPs was demonstrated by IFA and Western blot analysis. Electron microscopy results demonstrated that SUDV VLPs had a filamentous morphology. The immunogenicity of SUDV VLPs produced in insect cells was evaluated by the immunization of mice. The analysis of antibody responses showed that mice vaccinated with SUDV VLPs and the adjuvant Montanide ISA 201 produced SUDV GP-specific IgG antibodies. Sera from SUDV VLP-immunized mice were able to block infection by SUDV GP pseudotyped HIV, indicating that a neutralizing antibody against the SUDV GP protein was produced. Furthermore, the activation of B cells in the group immunized with VLPs mixed with Montanide ISA 201 was significant one week after the primary immunization. Vaccination with the SUDV VLPs markedly increased the frequency of antigen-specific cells secreting type 1 and type 2 cytokines. To study the therapeutic effects of SUDV antibodies, horses were immunized with SUDV VLPs emulsified in Freund’s complete adjuvant or Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. The results showed that horses could produce SUDV GP-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. These results showed that SUDV VLPs demonstrate excellent immunogenicity and represent a promising approach for vaccine development against SUDV infection. Further, these horse anti-SUDV purified immunoglobulins lay a foundation for SUDV therapeutic drug research.","2530bf775255e8026438e91645aba95d0506928e","True","Viruses","as high as 67%–90%|1976|Sudan|VP40|rBV|VP40|VLPs|IFA|Western|VLPs|VLPs|ISA 201|IgG|Sera|VLP|GP|GP|201|one week|1|2|Freund|Freund","cc-by","","PMC7019897","31947873","PERCENT|DATE|GPE|PERSON|GPE|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|NORP|ORG|ORG|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG","PMC","2020 Jan 3","","10.3390/v12010064","comm_use_subset"

Accordingly, we identified a number of novel RNA viruses including astrovirus, rotavirus A, picorna-like virus and a narmovirus (paramyxovirus). In addition, we identified a sobemovirus and a novel luteovirus that likely originated from the rabbit diet. These newly discovered viruses were often divergent from those previously described. The novel astrovirus was most closely related to a virus sampled from the rodent-eating European roller bird (Coracias garrulous). PCR screening revealed that the novel narmovirus in the UK field vole had a prevalence of approximately 4%, and shared common ancestry with other rodent narmoviruses sampled globally. Two novel rotavirus A sequences were detected in a UK field vole and a French rabbit, the latter with a prevalence of 5%. Finally, a highly divergent picorna-like virus found in the gut of the French rabbit virus was only ~35% similar to an arilivirus at the amino acid level, suggesting the presence of a novel viral genus within the Picornaviridae.","ce248b901191d45f3e56f1e6664a0239738aa148","True","Viruses","RNA|European|RNA|European|Coracias|UK|approximately 4%|Two|UK|French|5%|French|Picornaviridae","cc-by","","PMC7019641","31906044","ORG|NORP|ORG|NORP|ORG|GPE|PERCENT|CARDINAL|GPE|NORP|PERCENT|NORP|GPE","PMC","2019 Dec 31","","10.3390/v12010047","comm_use_subset"
"Wenham, Clare; Smith, Julia; Morgan, Rosemary","COVID-19: the gendered impacts of the outbreak","Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.1 The response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears no different. We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2 Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3 or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4 However, current sex-disaggregated data are incomplete, cautioning against early assumptions. Simultaneously, data from the State Council Information Office in China suggest that more than 90% of health-care workers in Hubei province are women, emphasising the gendered nature of the health workforce and the risk that predominantly female health workers incur.","d1d9fc1e02e0c09e39b1d37f64ddf8e24d19b4b9","True","The Lancet","2019|COVID-19|COVID-19|the State Council Information Office|China|more than 90%|Hubei","els-covid","#5424","","","DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERCENT|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-20","3006304371","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30526-2","custom_license"

The continuous emergence of a multitude of IBV variants poses many challenges for its diagnosis and control, and live attenuated vaccines, despite their routine use, still plays a significant role in driving IBV evolution, further complicating the epidemiological scenario. Unfortunately, the impact of different vaccination strategies on IB control, epidemiology, and diagnosis has rarely been investigated. This work presents the results of a large-scale diagnostic survey performed in Poland to study IBV molecular epidemiology and how vaccination may affect the viral circulation in the field. To this purpose, 589 samples were collected between May 2017 and January 2019, tested by reverse transcription-PCR for IBV and sequenced. Vaccine and field strains were discriminated based on genetic and anamnestic information. The most commonly detected lineages were 793B (79%) and variant 2 (17.4%), with sporadic detections of QX, Mass, and D274-like strains. Most of the detected strains had a vaccine origin: 46.3% matched one of the applied vaccines, while 36.5% were genetically related to vaccines not implemented in the respective protocol. Besides their practical value for the proper planning of vaccination protocols in Poland, these results suggest that only a fraction (17.2%) of the circulating strains are field ones, imposing a careful assessment of the actual IBV field menaces. Moreover, phenomena like vaccine spreading and persistence seem to occur commonly, stressing the need to further study the epidemiological consequences of the extensive use of live vaccines.","319b8c97174d684a0e0f50dff4ecfdab294d2a05; b574bf0f935b4f092e6df566f24ce24020474b66","True","Poult Sci","IB|IBV|IBV|IBV|IB|Poland|IBV|589|May 2017|January 2019|IBV|793B|79%|2|17.4%|QX|D274-like|46.3%|one|36.5%|Poland|17.2%|IBV","cc-by-nc","","PMC6870560","31399745","GPE|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL|DATE|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|GPE|PERCENT|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 9","","10.3382/ps/pez473","noncomm_use_subset"

"Saraswat, Shweta; Chaudhary, Meenakshi; Sehgal, Deepak","Hepatitis E Virus Cysteine Protease Has Papain Like Properties Validated by in silico Modeling and Cell-Free Inhibition Assays","Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has emerged as a global health concern during the last decade. In spite of a high mortality rate in pregnant women with fulminant hepatitis, no antiviral drugs or licensed vaccine is available in India. HEV-protease is a pivotal enzyme responsible for ORF1 polyprotein processing leading to cleavage of the non-structural enzymes involved in virus replication. HEV-protease region encoding 432–592 amino acids of Genotype-1 was amplified, expressed in Sf21 cells and purified in its native form. The recombinant enzyme was biochemically characterized using SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and Immunofluorescence. The enzyme activity and the inhibition studies were conducted using Zymography, FTC-casein based protease assay and ORF1 polyprotein digestion. To conduct ORF1 digestion assay, the polyprotein, natural substrate of HEV-protease, was expressed in E. coli and purified. Cleavage of 186 kDa ORF1 polyprotein by the recombinant HEV-protease lead to appearance of non-structural proteins viz. Methyltransferase, Protease, Helicase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase which were confirmed through immunoblotting using antibodies generated against specific epitopes of the enzymes. FTC-casein substrate was used for kinetic studies to determine Km and Vmax of the enzyme and also the effect of different metal ions and other protease inhibitors. A 95% inhibition was observed with E-64 which was validated through in silico analysis. The correlation coefficient between inhibition and docking score of Inhibitors was found to have a significant value of r(2) = 0.75. The predicted 3D model showed two domain architecture structures similar to Papain like cysteine protease though they differed in arrangements of alpha helices and beta sheets. Hence, we propose that HEV-protease has characteristics of “Papain-like cysteine protease,” as determined through structural homology, active site residues and class-specific inhibition. However, conclusive nature of the enzyme remains to be established.","ac5854f7ef4751d0a621fafd02e4cd05b08321cb","True","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","the last decade|India|Genotype-1|SDS|Immunofluorescence|Zymography|FTC|ORF1|HEV|186|kDa|Helicase|RNA|RNA|FTC|Km and Vmax of|95%|E-64|r(2|0.75|two|Papain","cc-by","","PMC6989534","32039053","DATE|GPE|FAC|ORG|PRODUCT|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE","PMC","2020 Jan 23","","10.3389/fcimb.2019.00478","comm_use_subset"

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections could improve clinical outcomes and reduce the use of antibiotics and treatment sessions. Advances in diagnostic technology contribute to the accurate detection of viruses. We performed a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to investigate the viral etiology in pediatric patients and compared the detection rates with those determined using traditional antigen tests and virus cultures. Fifteen respiratory viruses were included in our investigation: respiratory syncytial virus A/B (RSV), influenza virus A (FluA) and influenza virus B (FluB), human metapneumovirus (MPV), enterovirus (EV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1–4, human rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus OC43, NL63, and 229E, human adenovirus (ADV), and human bocavirus (Boca). In total, 474 specimens were collected and tested. Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently by PCR (357, 75.3%) than they were by traditional tests (229, 49.3%). The leading pathogens were RSV (113, 23.8%), RV (72, 15.2%), PIV3 (53, 11.2%), FluA (51, 10.8%), and ADV (48, 10.1%). For children younger than 5 years, RSV and RV were most prevalent; for children older than 5 years, FluA and ADV were the most frequently detected. Of the specimens, 25.8% (92/357) were coinfected with two or more viruses. RV, Boca, PIV2, FluB, and PIV4 had higher rates of coinfection; MPV and PIV1 had the lowest rates of coinfection (9.1% and 5.3%). To conclude, the detection power of PCR was better than that of traditional antigen tests and virus cultures when considering the detection of respiratory viruses. RSV and RV were the leading viral pathogens identified in the respiratory specimens. One-quarter of the positive specimens were coinfected with two or more viruses. In the future, further application of PCR may contribute to the rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses and could improve patient outcomes.","fd4ab143e7dd8db7255b11177505986e87b50943","True","Int J Environ Res Public Health","RTI|Fifteen|RSV|MPV|PIV|1–4|RV|229E|ADV|474|PCR|357|75.3%|229|49.3%|RSV|113|23.8%|RV|72|15.2%|53|11.2%|51|10.8%|ADV|48|10.1%|younger than 5 years|RSV|RV|older than 5 years|ADV|25.8%|92/357|two|RV|Boca|MPV|9.1%|5.3%|PCR|RSV|RV|One-quarter|two","cc-by","","PMC7013517","31952364","ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|ORG|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL","PMC","2020 Jan 15","","10.3390/ijerph17020564","comm_use_subset"

As a result, twelve newly generated sets of sequencing data from Canada and Poland were added to a pool of previously investigated samples. While the population-based analysis showed a segregation of viruses of ERA vaccine-induced rabies cases from those of SAD Bern original (SAD Bern(orig))-derived rabies cases, the in-depth variant analysis revealed three distinct combinations of selected variants for the ERA vaccine-induced cases, suggesting the presence of multiple replication-competent haplotypes in the investigated ERA-BHK21 vaccine.

In some outbreaks, the intervention has evoked controversy and community resistance. This study evaluated how local opinion leaders in US localities affected by Zika think about community engagement in public health policies for outbreak response. In December 2017 through March 2018, 4 focus groups were convened in Houston, TX, New Orleans, LA, Miami, FL, and Brooklyn, NY. They discussed a hypothetical scenario that featured vector control by aerial spraying. Participants (N = 20) more readily accepted this vector control method under 4 conditions: They were informed of alternatives, benefits, and risks for human health and the environment. Public health claims were backed by objective evidence and an authority figure genuinely working in the community’s interests. They received timely notice about how to mitigate toxin exposure. And, aerial spraying helped to protect vulnerable individuals. The community engagement requirements of the local opinion leaders resonate with core principles of recent public health ethics frameworks: namely, personal autonomy, transparency, reasonableness, and solidarity. Participants foresaw problems with community consent in an era of growing social media use and mistrust in governmental and scientific authority.

Healthcare workers and visitors can serve as transmission vectors to patients. We hypothesized that improved family and visitor hand hygiene (FVHH) and visitor screening would reduce HARVIs by at least 25%. METHODS: This quality improvement project took place in a large tertiary NICU to reduce HARVIs. Interventions primarily focused on improving FVHH and reducing visitation by symptomatic family members and visitors. We defined correct FVHH as hand hygiene performed immediately before touching their child. Hand hygiene observations were performed by direct observation by NICU staff using a standardized tool. Interventions to improve FVHH included education of staff and visitors, reminder signs, and immediate reminders to families to prevent lapses in hand hygiene. Staff screened family and visitors before NICU entry. Symptomatic individuals were asked to defer visitation until symptoms resolved. HARVIs were identified during prospective surveillance by infection preventionists using standard definitions. RESULTS: Baseline FVHH was 27% in 2015. After May 2017, the average FVHH remained at 85%. When reminded, family members and visitors performed hand hygiene 99% of the time. Staff screened ~129,000 people for FVHH. Between January 2013 and March 2019, there were 74 HARVIs; 80% were rhinovirus/enterovirus. After the implementation of improved FVHH, the HARVI rate decreased from 0.67 to 0.23/1,000 patient days. CONCLUSIONS: Adding interventions to improve FVHH and visitor management to existing healthcare worker prevention efforts can help reduce HARVIs in the NICU.","ca247deecd89fea456e741ed2a23a8e1213471c3","True","Pediatr Qual Saf","Healthcare|Healthcare|FVHH|at least 25%|METHODS|tertiary|FVHH|FVHH|Hand|NICU|FVHH|NICU|27%|2015|May 2017|FVHH|85%|99%|FVHH|Between January 2013 and March 2019|74|HARVIs|80%|FVHH|HARVI|0.67 to 0.23/1,000|FVHH","cc-by-nc-nd","","PMC6946222","32010868","ORG|ORG|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|ORG|ORG|GPE|PERCENT|DATE|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|PERCENT|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|ORG|PERCENT|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 16","","10.1097/pq9.0000000000000242","noncomm_use_subset"
"Peckham, Robert","COVID-19 and the anti-lessons of history","As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China's Hubei province continues and new cases of the disease increase globally,1 there is pressure on historians to show the value of history for policy. How can the past assist in the real-time management of the crisis? What insights can be gleaned from the ongoing epidemic for future disease preparedness and prevention? Lurking in the background of these interrogatives is a more or less explicit accusation: why haven't past lessons been learned? The gist of some commentaries seems to be: “there is almost nothing surprising about this pandemic”.2 The history-as-lessons approach pivots on the assumption that epidemics are structurally comparable events, wherever and whenever they take place. The COVID-19 outbreak “creates a sense of déjà vu” with the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).3 Citing early estimates of the disease's infectiousness, based on an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan,4 comparisons have been drawn with the 1918–19 influenza pandemic.5 Although in some respects the outbreak of COVID-19 presents a compelling argument for why history matters, there are problems with analogical views of the past because they constrain our ability to grasp the complex place-and-time-specific variables that drive contemporary disease emergence. A lessons approach to epidemics produces what Kenneth Burke, borrowing from the economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen, called “trained incapacity”—“that state of affairs whereby one's very abilities can function as blindnesses”.6 Habitual modes of thinking can diminish our capacity to make lateral connections. When the present is viewed through the lens of former disease outbreaks, we typically focus on similitudes and overlook important differences. In other words, analogies create blind spots. As Burke commented, “a way of seeing is also a way of not seeing—a focus on object A involves a neglect of object B”.","734680f31840d5a79216db3115568a20c8f5fe20","True","The Lancet","2019|COVID-19|China|Hubei|COVID-19|2003|SARS).3 Citing|first|425|1918–19|COVID-19|Kenneth Burke|Thorstein Veblen|Burke","els-covid","#3136","","","DATE|ORG|GPE|GPE|PERSON|DATE|ORG|ORDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|PERSON|PERSON|PERSON","Elsevier","2020-03-20","2116636416","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30468-2","custom_license"
"Flahault, Antoine","Has China faced only a herald wave of SARS-CoV-2?","The attack rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) calculated by mathematical models, from estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2–3, suggests that 50–60% of the population should eventually be infected because the population seems to be entirely naive to the new virus.1 The observed attack rate on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship remained slightly below 20% (705 of 3711 passengers and crew members became infected).1 It is of upmost importance to know whether the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China is subsiding, as local authorities and the entire international community might wish. With 80 026 COVID-19 cases officially reported from China as of March 2, 2020,2 the proportion of the population affected remains far from 50%, or even 20%, of China's 1·4 billion people. Has China just experienced a herald wave, to use terminology borrowed from those who study tsunamis, and is the big wave still to come? Serosurveys can help answer these questions precisely.3 To serosurvey the outbreak would involve testing sera of blood samples from the most representative sample of the population at the epicentre of the epidemic, Wuhan. Serology analysis with neutralising antibodies from the 1000 people could allow for the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections to be estimated with good accuracy. This rate could be extrapolated to the city's entire population and thus inform more precisely whether the provisional attack rate during this period was a few cases per thousand or perhaps affected 1–2% of the population, 20%, or more. Serosurveys should be seen as polls before elections; they can be repeated several times,3 week after week, to monitor the epidemic precisely. There is no reason to wait for the end of the epidemic before doing serosurveys. The results would be tremendously informative to China, first and foremost, and to the entire international community, on the risk of big secondary epidemic waves","","False","The Lancet","2|R0|2–3|50–60%|Diamond|20%|705|3711|China|80 026 COVID-19|China|March 2|50%|20%|China|1·4 billion|China|Wuhan|1000|1–2%|20%|several times,3 week|China|first","els-covid","#4102","","","CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERSON|PERCENT|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|DATE|PERCENT|PERCENT|GPE|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|PERCENT|PERCENT|DATE|GPE|ORDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-04","3006355661","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30521-3","custom_license"

Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. Methods In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. Findings From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. Interpretation Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing. Methods We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS. Findings By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%. Interpretation On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.

Of these, IFITM3 potently inhibits viruses that enter cells through acidic endosomes, many of which are zoonotic and emerging viruses with bats (order Chiroptera) as their natural hosts. We previously demonstrated that microbat IFITM3 is antiviral. Here, we show that bat IFITMs are characterized by strong adaptive evolution and identify a highly variable and functionally important site—codon 70—within the conserved CD225 domain of IFITMs. Mutation of this residue in microbat IFITM3 impairs restriction of representatives of four different virus families that enter cells via endosomes. This mutant shows altered subcellular localization and reduced S-palmitoylation, a phenotype copied by mutation of conserved cysteine residues in microbat IFITM3. Furthermore, we show that microbat IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated on cysteine residues C71, C72, and C105, mutation of each cysteine individually impairs virus restriction, and a triple C71A-C72A-C105A mutant loses all restriction activity, concomitant with subcellular re-localization of microbat IFITM3 to Golgi-associated sites. Thus, we propose that S-palmitoylation is critical for Chiropteran IFITM3 function and identify a key molecular determinant of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation.","a57080f174e3ede5138af08070a2b9db8f9c36a7","True","Life Sci Alliance","IFITM3|Chiroptera|IFITM3|70—within|CD225|four|S|IFITM3|IFITM3 is S|C71|C72|C105|C71A-C72A-C105A|IFITM3|Chiropteran IFITM3|IFITM3 S-palmitoylation","cc-by","","PMC6907390","31826928","ORG|ORG|ORG|CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|PRODUCT|PRODUCT|ORG|ORG|ORG","PMC","2019 Dec 11","","10.26508/lsa.201900542","comm_use_subset"
"Georgalakis, James","A disconnected policy network: The UK's response to the Sierra Leone Ebola epidemic","Abstract This paper investigates whether the inclusion of social scientists in the UK policy network that responded to the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone (2013–16) was a transformational moment in the use of interdisciplinary research. In contrast to the existing literature, that relies heavily on qualitative accounts of the epidemic and ethnography, this study tests the dynamics of the connections between critical actors with quantitative network analysis. This novel approach explores how individuals are embedded in social relationships and how this may affect the production and use of evidence. The meso-level analysis, conducted between March and June 2019, is based on the traces of individuals' engagement found in secondary sources. Source material includes policy and strategy documents, committee papers, meeting minutes and personal correspondence. Social network analysis software, UCINet, was used to analyse the data and Netdraw for the visualisation of the network. Far from being one cohesive community of experts and government officials, the network of 134 people was weakly held together by a handful of super-connectors. Social scientists’ poor connections to the government embedded biomedical community may explain why they were most successful when they framed their expertise in terms of widely accepted concepts. The whole network was geographically and racially almost entirely isolated from those affected by or directly responding to the crisis in West Africa. Nonetheless, the case was made for interdisciplinarity and the value of social science in emergency preparedness and response. The challenge now is moving from the rhetoric to action on complex infectious disease outbreaks in ways that value all perspectives equally.","e75eca2d1b8149aa2e8e18f1a0286a96485434fd","True","Social Science & Medicine","UK|Sierra Leone|2013–16|between March and June 2019|minutes|Netdraw|134|West Africa","els-covid","#817","","","GPE|GPE|PERSON|DATE|TIME|NORP|CARDINAL|GPE","Elsevier","2020-04-30","3006112521","10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.112851","custom_license"

Genomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, therefore bats could be the possible primary reservoir. The intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is not known, however, the rapid human to human transfer has been confirmed widely. There is no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine available to be used against COVID-19. However, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have been evaluated against COVID-19 in clinical trials, resulted in clinical recovery. In the current review, we summarize and comparatively analyze the emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection and previous human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We also discuss the approaches for developing effective vaccines and therapeutic combinations to cope with this viral outbreak.","05e2f08d487b551346b31083c115af7bd75c8dc2","True","Journal of Advanced Research","19|COVID-19|2|Wuhan|China|COVID-19|COVID-19","els-covid","#8831","","","CARDINAL|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|ORG|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-16","","10.1016/j.jare.2020.03.005","custom_license"

This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002–2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally. Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.","cd4f5118038ae33283d34a15f8c3888f00e247bc","True","Journal of Autoimmunity","2019-nCoV|COVID-19|China|1800|third|Coronavirus|less than 20 years|2002–2003|2012|Coronavirus|about 15%|Coronavirus|Huanan|Wuhan|Hubei|CoV|January 2020|Spanish|Asians","els-covid","#4387","","","CARDINAL|PERSON|GPE|QUANTITY|ORDINAL|ORG|DATE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|PERCENT|PERSON|NORP|GPE|GPE|PERSON|DATE|NORP|NORP","Elsevier","2020-03-03","2999409984","10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102434","custom_license"

To analyze the antigenicity and pathogenicity characteristics of the dominant genotype strains (QX-type), S1 gene sequence analysis, virus cross-neutralization tests, and pathogenicity test of eight QX-type IBV isolates were conducted. Sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide homology between the eight strains was high, but distantly related to H120 and 4/91 vaccine strains. Cross-neutralization tests showed that all eight strains isolated from 2015 and 2017 belonged to the same serotype, but exhibited antigenic variations over time. The pathogenicity test of the five QX-type IBV isolates showed that only three strains, CK/CH/SC/DYW/16, CK/CH/SC/MS/17, and CK/CH/SC/GH/15, had a high mortality rate with strong respiratory and renal pathogenicity, whereas CK/CH/SC/PZ/17 and CK/CH/SC/DYYJ/17 caused only mild clinical symptoms and tissue lesions. Our results indicate that the prevalent QX-type IBVs displayed antigenic variations and pathogenicity difference.

We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ≤1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. Findings 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0).

The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). Interpretation COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1–3 weeks.

Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. Methods We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk. Findings Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively. Interpretation Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.

Most virulence and resistance factors in S. aureus are encoded by mobile genetic elements, and transduction by bacteriophages represents the main mechanism for horizontal gene transfer. The baseplate is a specialized structure at the tip of bacteriophage tails that plays key roles in host recognition, cell wall penetration, and DNA ejection. We have used high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of the S. aureus bacteriophage 80α baseplate at 3.75 Å resolution, allowing atomic models to be built for most of the major tail and baseplate proteins, including two tail fibers, the receptor binding protein, and part of the tape measure protein. Our structure provides a structural basis for understanding host recognition, cell wall penetration and DNA ejection in viruses infecting Gram-positive bacteria.

Large outbreaks of human-to-human transmission have occurred, the largest in Riyadh and Jeddah in 2014 and in South Korea in 2015. MERS-CoV remains a high-threat pathogen identified by WHO as a priority pathogen because it causes severe disease that has a high mortality rate, epidemic potential, and no medical countermeasures. This Seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection control, development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and highlights unanswered questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.","e8d3d7ab031be52d7e69b0070488d8c43e2f00fb","True","The Lancet","Summary|Middle East|CoV|first|Saudi Arabia|Jordan|2012|CoV|Between April 2012|December 2019|2499|CoV|858|34·3%|27|WHO|Saudi Arabia|2106|780|Riyadh|Jeddah|2014|South Korea|2015|CoV|WHO|Seminar","els-covid","#3836","","","GPE|LOC|PERSON|ORDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|PERSON|DATE|DATE|DATE|PERSON|CARDINAL|PERCENT|CARDINAL|ORG|GPE|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|GPE|GPE|DATE|GPE|DATE|PERSON|ORG|GPE","Elsevier","2020-03-04","2112147913","10.1016/S0140-6736(19)33221-0","custom_license"

The aim of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, 149 RT-PCR confirmed positive patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th, 2020. Findings A total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms, 14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C-reactive protein. On chest computed tomography (CT), lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented consolidation. Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy form. No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei exposure history. Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had negative findings even10 days later. Interpretation Most patients presented with a mild infection in our study. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed opacity with predominance in the lower lung is highly suspicious of COVID-19 in the first week of disease onset. Nevetheless, some patients can present with a normal chest finding despite testing positive for COVID-19.

"Chang, Le; Yan, Ying; Wang, Lunan","Coronavirus Disease 2019: Coronaviruses and Blood Safety","Abstract With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), aroused the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections—SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012—both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by β-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS–CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.","a9a4101b25236a4fc0e14a9cbdd904ca8b2baffd","True","Transfusion Medicine Reviews","Wuhan|China|December 2019|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus|Coronavirus Disease 2019|COVID-19|The World Health Organization|China|International Concern|Two|2002-2003|Middle East Respiratory Syndrome|3|COVID-19|CoV|February 10, 2020","els-covid","#1681","","","GPE|GPE|DATE|ORG|ORG|ORG|ORG|GPE|GPE|CARDINAL|DATE|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|PERSON|DATE","Elsevier","2020-02-21","2892593968","10.1016/j.tmrv.2020.02.003","custom_license"

Whole genome sequencing enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub-genomic sequences. RESULTS: We report a 2-reaction amplicon-based next generation sequencing method to determine the complete genome sequences of five HMPV strains, representing three subgroups (A2, B1 and B2), directly from clinical samples. In addition to reporting five novel HMPV genomes from Africa we examined genetic diversity and sequence patterns of publicly available HMPV genomes. We found that the overall nucleotide sequence identity was 71.3 and 80% for HMPV group A and B, respectively, the diversity between HMPV groups was greater at amino acid level for SH and G surface protein genes, and multiple subgroups co-circulated in various countries. Comparison of sequences between HMPV groups revealed variability in G protein length (219 to 241 amino acids) due to changes in the stop codon position. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis showed congruence with the individual gene sequence sets except for F and M2 genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first genomic characterization of HMPV genomes from African patients.","f5ae3f66face323615df39d838e056ab5fcc98df","True","BMC Genomics","2-reaction|five|three|B1|five|Africa|71.3|80%|SH|219|241|first|African","cc-by","","PMC6941262","31898474","CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|LOC|GPE|PERCENT|ORG|CARDINAL|CARDINAL|ORDINAL|NORP","PMC","2020 Jan 2","","10.1186/s12864-019-6400-z","comm_use_subset"

If everyone puts on a mask in public places, it would help to remove stigmatisation that has hitherto discouraged masking of symptomatic patients in many places.3 Furthermore, transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals has been documented for COVID-19, and viral load is particularly high at early disease stage.4 , 5 Masking, as a public health intervention, would probably intercept the transmission link and prevent these apparently healthy infectious sources.","","False","The Lancet","COVID-19|5","els-covid","#3483","","","ORG|CARDINAL","Elsevier","2020-03-03","3006419170","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30520-1","custom_license"

Recently we have identified that the peptide PH((1–110)) from polyhedrin self-aggregates and incorporates foreign proteins to form particles. We have proposed that this peptide can be used as an antigen carrying system for vaccines. However, the immune response generated by the antigen fused to the peptide has not been fully characterized. In addition, the adjuvant effect and thermostability of the particles has not been evaluated. RESULTS: In the present study we demonstrate the use of a system developed to generate nano and microparticles carrying as a fusion protein peptides or proteins of interest to be used as vaccines. These particles are purified easily by centrifugation. Immunization of animals with the particles in the absence of adjuvant result in a robust and long-lasting immune response. Proteins contained inside the particles are maintained for over 1 year at ambient temperature, preserving their immunological properties. CONCLUSION: The rapid and efficient production of the particles in addition to the robust immune response they generate position this system as an excellent method for the rapid response against emerging diseases. The thermostability conferred by the particle system facilitates the distribution of the vaccines in developing countries or areas with no electricity.","e1f2c0859f44eaf3e7a2110a5ca98ac0104815bc","True","BMC Biotechnol","Proteins|over 1 year","cc-by","","PMC6971912","31959159","GPE|DATE","PMC","2020 Jan 21","","10.1186/s12896-019-0592-9","comm_use_subset"

These bacteria favored a lower temperature for their prolonged survival on the dry fomites, regardless of the material type. Interestingly, when mixed with S. aureus, E. coli survived for a longer time at a lower temperature. Cardiolipin, which can promote the survival of S. aureus in harsh environments, had no effect on maintaining the survival of E. coli. Although the trends remained unchanged, adjusting the humidity from 40% to 60% affected the survival of bacteria on dry surfaces. Scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed no morphological differences in these bacteria immediately before or after one day of dry conditions. In addition, ATP assessment, a method used to visualize high-touch surfaces in hospitals, was not effective at monitoring bacterial dynamics. A specialized handrail device fitted with a heater, which was maintained at normal human body core temperature, successfully prohibited the prolonged survival of bacteria [Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC), E. coli (ATCC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC), S. aureus (ATCC), Acinetobacter baumannii (clinical isolate), and Serratia marcescens (clinical isolate)], with the exception of spore-forming Bacillus subtilis (from our laboratory collection) and the yeast-like fungus Candida albicans (from our laboratory collection)] on dry surfaces. Taken together, we concluded that the tested bacteria favor lower temperatures for their survival in dry environments. Therefore, the thermal control of dry fomites has the potential to control bacterial survival on high-touch surfaces in hospitals.","e6e057796aa14fa1808ee7076da0109362acb7c9","True","PLoS One","Escherichia|Clinical|New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase|Staphylococcus|ATCC|15|°|S.|Cardiolipin|S.|40% to 60%|before or after one day|ATP|Enterococcus faecalis|ATCC|Pseudomonas|ATCC)|S.|ATCC|Acinetobacter|Serratia|Candida","cc-by","","PMC6934310","31881059","PERSON|ORG|GPE|PERSON|ORG|CARDINAL|GPE|PERSON|GPE|NORP|PERCENT|DATE|ORG|ORG|PERSON|GPE|ORG|PERSON|ORG|PERSON|ORG|GPE","PMC","2019 Dec 27","","10.1371/journal.pone.0226952","comm_use_subset"

First, after variable periods of adaptation, the three locations took actions to manage the outbreak of a new pathogen. Surveillance systems were readjusted to identify potential cases while public health staff identified their contacts. National laboratory networks developed diagnostic tests once the COVID-19 genetic sequences were published5 and laboratory testing capacity was increased in all three locations, although expansion of the diagnostic capacity to university and large private laboratories in Japan is still ongoing. In Hong Kong, initially, only pneumonia patients without a microbiological diagnosis were tested, but surveillance has been broadened to include all inpatients with pneumonia and a purposively sampled proportion of outpatients and emergency attendees totalling about 1500 per day (Leung GM, unpublished).

Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. Methods 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages. Results The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens.
