        <h4>System Overview</h4>

        <h4>Radar chart design:</h4>

        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 2. Examples of Radar design for hourly multivariate summary of 3 regions: Palace Hills, Safe Town, and Southon.</span></p>

        <div> Due to the limited screen display and a large number of data entries, we revise the radar chart to embed the transformed color scale directly into the inside area of the radar. Our customized radar adopts the box plot layout which shows the five-number summary: minimum (inner curve), first quartile, median (dashed curve), third quartile, and maximum (outer curve). This allows users to quickly spot the multivariate values (<i>shake intensitive</i> and various <i>types of damage</i>) as depicted in Figure 2. In the examples in the report show the hourly summary (from left to right) of various regions (top down) of St. Himark</div>

         <p class="caption"><span>Figure 3. Radar controll: Color selection, radar band selection, radar value fitering, and angle vs. variable selection.</span></p>

         <div> In the control panel, we allow users to fully customize the radar layout, including color scales (blue for low damage and red for high damage), radar inner and outer curves (min+max vs. q1+q3), value filtering (such as only high <i>shake intensitive</i>), and  angles of each dimension (how to order variables on the radar).</div>

            <h4>Questions</h4>

        <div class="question">1- Emergency responders will base their initial response on the earthquake shake map. Use visual analytics to determine how their response should change based on damage reports from citizens on the ground. How would you prioritize neighborhoods for response? Which parts of the city are hardest hit? Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.</div>




        <div class="question">2 - Use visual analytics to show uncertainty in the data. Compare the reliability of neighborhood reports. Which neighborhoods are providing reliable reports? Provide a rationale for your response. Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.</div>


        <div class="question">3 - How do conditions change over time? How does uncertainty in change over time? Describe the key changes you see. Limit your response to 500 words and 8 images.</div>
