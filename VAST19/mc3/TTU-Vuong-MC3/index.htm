        <div>Control zone includes <ul>
                <li>Search box: for searching user, location or category </li>
                <li>Category legend: click on category name to show or hide that category </li>

        <div> TimeArc have 2 main components: the stream graph of terms/topics and the link between 2 topics present the connection. The thicker of link display the stronger connection between them. This connection has been calculate by how coincident 2 world present in the same message. </div>
        <div> The data using in this application is processed directly on web. The process sequence includes removing duplicated post (such as repeated posts) and spam (sale promotion), extract keyworks basing on category definition and aggregate post content by hour.</div>

        <h4>Questions</h4>

        <div class="question">1- Using visual analytics, characterize conditions across the city and recommend how resources should be allocated at 5 hours and 30 hours after the earthquake. Include evidence from the data to support these recommendations. Consider how to allocate resources such as road crews, sewer repair crews, power, and rescue teams. Limit your response to 1000 words and 12 images.</div>
        <img id="earthquake" src="images/earthquaketerms.PNG" class="full">
        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 2. Examples of locations and 'sewer_and_water' relating to earthquake event.</span></p>
        <div>The Figure 2 shows earthquake event have 3 pulse (2pm Mon 06, 7am Wed 08, 2pm Thu 09). The 2nd pulse have strong relation ship with Downtown.
            West Parton and Palace Hills and the 3rd pulse have more connections than the 2nd, especially with the Cheddarford, Weston and Southton.
        </div>
        <div> The distribution of resource can be mapping with resource name in this aplication:
            <ul>
                <li> road crews: roads_and_bridges</li>
                <li> sewer repair crews: sewer_and_water</li>
                <li> power: power/energy</li>
                <li> rescue teams: medical</li>
            </ul>
            The "earthquake" term can be the reference for finding need of resource in order to prevent spam and advertisement message
            (e.g: unuseful message in message table in Figure 1).
        </div>
        <img id="roads_and_bridgesvsearth" src="images/road_earth.PNG" class="full">
        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 3. "roads_and_bridges" connect with "earthquake" event.</span></p>
        <div>
            Road crews need to be assigned during 1 hours after 2nd earthquake pulse and 5 hours after 3rd earthquake pulse.
            The map in Figure 3 shows 3 possible location to send Road crews: Neighbor 11,12 and 16.

        <div>
            sewer repair crews need to be assigned during 5 hours after 2nd earthquake pulse.
            The map in Figure 4 shows 3 possible location to send Road crews: Neighbor 4, 17 and 19. However, base on the message content, the Oak Willow had false a report.

        <div>
            Different from previous resource, power doesn't have directly connection with earthqurake, but, it have strong link with road and bridge
            According to Figure 5, 2 main locations have problem with power are: Neighbor 5 and 13. This condition happend 6hours after 2nd earthquake.

        <h4>Question</h4>

        <div class="question">2- Identify at least 3 times when conditions change in a way that warrants a re-allocation of city resources. What were the conditions before and after the inflection point? What locations were affected? Which resources are involved? Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.</div>
        <img id="mapall" src="images/mapall.png" class="full">
        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 7. The condition change in 3 time range A, B and C.</span></p>
        <div>At the 1st time point (A), Medical and roads are involved mostly in Downtown. The 2nd wave of demand (B) is after the major earthquake require all resources and the most essential resource is medical in entire city.
        The final wave of demand (C) requires Medical, Power and Sewer from center of the city.</div>

        <div class="question">3- Take the pulse of the community. How has the earthquake affect life in St. Himark? What is the community experiencing outside the realm of the first two questions? Show decision makers summary information and relevant/characteristic examples. Limit your response to 800 words and 8 images.</div>

        <div>The data using in this application is an array of message and have been process directly from web browser. In the real situation with larger dataset, the best solution is using web server which process the data before
        sending the extract terms to client via web api. Moreover, the accuracy of this method can be improve if using server rather than using client browser. However, whether using server or not, our web application still have ability to
        analysis static and dynamic data.</div>
