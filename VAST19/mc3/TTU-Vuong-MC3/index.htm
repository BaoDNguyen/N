        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 1. Our visual interface: (top-left) control panel, (top) main time series view and (bottom) message table </span></p>

        <div> The challenge data is processed directly within the web browser, including removing duplicated/repeated posts, removing spams (sale promotions), extracting keyworks basing on an earthquake taxonomy, and aggregating posts by hour. To determine the problems that are occurring across the St. Himark, we first built the taxonomy for 1) Types of event related to the earthquake and 2) Types of resources that needed for the situation. The taxonomy: 
1. Event, including:
1.1. Earthquake: seismic, earthquake, quake, quaking, shake, shaking, wobble, wobbling, quiver, epicenter
1.2. Grounds (ground damage): mudslide, rupture, landslides, liquefaction
1.3. Flooding: tsunami, flood
1.4. Aftershock: aftershock
1.5. Fire: fire, smoke
2. Resources, including:
2.1. Water: sewage, water, discharge, drain, irrigation, sewer, reservoir
2.2. Energy: blackout, electric, candle, energy, flashlight, fuel, gas, generator, nuclear, power, radiant, radiation, radio rays, valve
2.3. Medical: ambulance, blood, bruise, dehydrate, emergency, escape, evacuate, evacuating, evacuation, fatal, first aid, fracture, hurt, illness, infection, injure, kill, lump, medic, red cross, rescue, rescuing, respiratory, suffering, swollen, urgent, victim, wound
2.4. Shelter: shelter, housing, building, collapse, construction, house
2.5. Transportation: bridge, traffic, congestion, avalanche, highway, lane, logistic, jammed, route, street, transportation
2.6. Food: food

        <div> Our visualization has 3 main components:<br><br>

            <b>1. Control panel</b> includes 
            <ul>
                <li>Search box: To filter the main view by the inputted term </li>
                <li>Color legend: Such as Green for users, Blue for resourses. Users can click on these names to show/hide that category in the main view</li>
                <li>Link filter: adjust threshold for link thickness. </li>

                <li>The St. Himark map: To allow users to select regions of interest. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--<p class="caption"><span>Figure 2. Examples of TimeArc result relating to earthquake event.</span></p>-->

        <div> <b>2. Main view: </b><br> We use the dynamic netwrok visualization, called <a href="https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/TimeArcs">TimeArc</a>, to visulize the evolution of different topics and the correlations between them. As shown in the main view of Figure 1, TimeArc has 2 main components: the stream graphs of topics depict the popularity of these topics over time and the arcs between topics present the cooccurrences in the text messages from social media posts. The thickness of links indicates how often the 2 topics mentioned together in Y*INT messages. </div><br>

        <div> <b>3. Detail view: </b><br>
        The detailed Y*INT messages of a partucular events/topics are presented to users in tabular format on demand. This allows users to investigate into the content of the social media posts by selecting a topic or a link in our time series view (TimeArcs).

        <h4>Questions</h4>

        <div class="question">1- Using visual analytics, characterize conditions across the city and recommend how resources should be allocated at 5 hours and 30 hours after the earthquake. Include evidence from the data to support these recommendations. Consider how to allocate resources such as road crews, sewer repair crews, power, and rescue teams. Limit your response to 1000 words and 12 images.</div>
        <img id="earthquake" src="images/earthquaketerms.PNG" class="full">
        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 2. Examples of locations and 'sewer_and_water' relating to earthquake event.</span></p>
        <div>The Figure 2 shows earthquake event have 3 pulse (2pm Mon 06, 7am Wed 08, 2pm Thu 09). The 2nd pulse have strong relation ship with Downtown.
            West Parton and Palace Hills and the 3rd pulse have more connections than the 2nd, especially with the Cheddarford, Weston and Southton.
        </div>
        <div> The distribution of resource can be mapping with resource name in this aplication:
            <ul>
                <li> road crews: roads_and_bridges</li>
                <li> sewer repair crews: sewer_and_water</li>
                <li> power: power/energy</li>
                <li> rescue teams: medical</li>
            </ul>
            The "earthquake" term can be the reference for finding need of resource in order to prevent spam and advertisement message
            (e.g: unuseful message in message table in Figure 1).
        </div>
        <img id="roads_and_bridgesvsearth" src="images/road_earth.PNG" class="full">
        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 3. "roads_and_bridges" connect with "earthquake" event.</span></p>
        <div>
            Road crews need to be assigned during 1 hours after 2nd earthquake pulse and 5 hours after 3rd earthquake pulse.
            The map in Figure 3 shows 3 possible location to send Road crews: Neighbor 11,12 and 16.

        <div>
            sewer repair crews need to be assigned during 5 hours after 2nd earthquake pulse.
            The map in Figure 4 shows 3 possible location to send Road crews: Neighbor 4, 17 and 19. However, base on the message content, the Oak Willow had false a report.

        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 5. "power/energy" connect with "roads_and_bridges" event.</span></p>
        <div>
            Different from previous resource, power doesn't have directly connection with earthqurake, but, it have strong link with road and bridge
            According to Figure 5, 2 main locations have problem with power are: Neighbor 5 and 13. This condition happend 6hours after 2nd earthquake.

            There are 3 main locations: Neighbor 6, 2 and 3 marked on the map need attention about medical.

        <h4>Question</h4>

        <div class="question">2- Identify at least 3 times when conditions change in a way that warrants a re-allocation of city resources. What were the conditions before and after the inflection point? What locations were affected? Which resources are involved? Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.</div>
        <img id="mapall" src="images/mapall.png" class="full">
        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 7. The condition change in 3 time range A, B and C.</span></p>
        <div>At the 1st time point (A), Medical and roads are involved mostly in Downtown. The 2nd wave of demand (B) is after the major earthquake require all resources and the most essential resource is medical in entire city.
        The final wave of demand (C) requires Medical, Power and Sewer from center of the city.</div>

        <div class="question">3- Take the pulse of the community. How has the earthquake affect life in St. Himark? What is the community experiencing outside the realm of the first two questions? Show decision makers summary information and relevant/characteristic examples. Limit your response to 800 words and 8 images.</div>

        <div>The data using in this application is an array of message and have been process directly from web browser. In the real situation with larger dataset, the best solution is using web server which process the data before
        sending the extract terms to client via web api. Moreover, the accuracy of this method can be improve if using server rather than using client browser. However, whether using server or not, our web application still have ability to
        analysis static and dynamic data.</div>
