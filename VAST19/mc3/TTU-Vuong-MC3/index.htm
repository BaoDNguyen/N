        <h4>Questions</h4>

        <div class="question">1- Using visual analytics, characterize conditions across the city and recommend how resources should be allocated at 5 hours and 30 hours after the earthquake. Include evidence from the data to support these recommendations. Consider how to allocate resources such as road crews, sewer repair crews, power, and rescue teams. Limit your response to 1000 words and 12 images.</div>

The Figure 2 (B) The 2nd pulse have strong relation ship with Downtown,
            West Parton and Palace Hills and the 3rd pulse have more connections than the 2nd, such as Weston, Southton, Cheddarford, Southwest, East Parton and Boardview. In Figure 2 (B), the map show only posts related to the strong connection.

        <div>
        There is the sight of broken sewer pipe in Downtown just 2 hour after earthquake ( Figiure 4 (B) ). Then, 5 hours after earthquake, the peak of sewer demand is reached because the broken sewer pipe lead to risk of <b>contaminated drinking water</b>.
            That happen in Old Town, Safe Town, Scenic Vista, Broadview, Chapparal and Easton. In the next 5 hours, the situation became worst and lead to <b>flooding</b> in Old Town. From this point, the sewer crew need to be assign in the area zone around Safe town. Moreover,
            the sewer problem around 3rd earthquake is not as serious as the 2nd. However, from citizen posts (C), the sewer system is not recover and come to solution using portable restroom for a month.

        <div>The data using in this application is an array of message and have been process directly from web browser. In the real situation with larger dataset, the best solution is using web server which process the data before
        sending the extract terms to client via web api. Moreover, the accuracy of this method can be improve if using server rather than using client browser. However, whether using server or not, our web application still have ability to
