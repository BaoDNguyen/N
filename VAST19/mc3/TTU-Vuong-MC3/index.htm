        <div> The challenge data is processed directly within the web browser, including removing duplicated/repeated posts, removing spams (sale promotions), extracting keyworks based on an earthquake taxonomy, and aggregating posts by hour. To determine the problems across the St. Himark, we first built the earthquake taxonomy for related events and resources needed for the situation:<br><br>
        <b>Events:</b>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Earthquake: seismic, earthquake, quake, quaking, shake, shaking, wobble, wobbling, quiver, epicenter</li>
                        <li>Ground damage: mudslide, rupture, landslides, liquefaction</li>
                        <li>Flooding: tsunami, flood</li>
                        <li>Aftershock: aftershock</li>
                        <li>Fire: fire, smoke, burn</li>
                    </ul>

        <div> <b>2. Main view: </b><br> We use the dynamic netwrok visualization, called <a href="https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/TimeArcs">TimeArc</a>, to visulize the evolution of different topics and the correlations between them. As shown in the main view of Figure 1, TimeArc has 2 main components: the stream graphs of topics depict the popularity of these topics over time and the arcs between topics present the cooccurrences in the text messages from social media posts. The thickness of links indicates how often the 2 topics mentioned together in Y*INT messages. </div><br>

        <div> <b>3. Detail view: </b><br>
        The detailed Y*INT messages of a partucular events/topics are presented to users in tabular format on demand. This allows users to investigate into the content of the social media posts by selecting a topic or a link in our time series view (TimeArcs).

        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <br>

        <div class="question">1- Using visual analytics, characterize conditions across the city and recommend how resources should be allocated at 5 hours and 30 hours after the earthquake. Include evidence from the data to support these recommendations. Consider how to allocate resources such as road crews, sewer repair crews, power, and rescue teams. Limit your response to 1000 words and 12 images.</div>

        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 2. Our Earthquake visualization: (A)Frequency of earthquake-related terms and (B) Temporal network of earthquake and the associated regions.</span></p>

        <div> Figure 2(A) shows the 3 earthquakes (at 2pm Mon 06, 7am Wed 08, and 2pm Thu 09). In particular, the purple stream depicts the aggregated frequency of earthquake-related terms (listed in the above taxonomy): seismic, quake, shake, shaking, wobble, quiver, epicenter. On the left, St. Himark map is colored by number of earthquake-related posts. <br>
        As shown in Figure 2(B), the 2nd pulse is strongly connected to Downtown and West Parton while the 3rd pulse have many more connections to Weston, Southton, Cheddarford, Southwest, East Parton and Boardview. In Figure 2(B), the map is color-coded by only posts associated to these connections (arcs).

<page size="A3">
    <div class="pageContent">

        <div> Now, we are going to focus on the following resource allocations: roads and bridges, sewer and water, power and energy, and medical.
        </div>
        <br>
        <b> 1.1. Roads and bridges</b>
        <img id="road" src="images/road.png" class="full">
        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 3. Roads and bridges (<font style="color:#48c;">blue</font> stream) and the related posts/stories.</span></p>
        <div>

        We can focus on roads and bridges by input this category into the search box. We inserted the <font style="color:#f0f;">pink</font> annotated text on top of our time series for explanation purpose. As depicted in Figure 3(A), the concerns on roads and bridges are posted as soon as (2nd and 3rd) earthquakes occurs. The posts at 1 hour after the 2nd earthquake are annoucements of roads/bridges closures as shown in Figure 3(b). At 5 hours after the 2nd earthquake, some further annoucements are posted. In particular, Magritte Bridge and Wilson Forest Highway are re-opened at this hour as depicted in Figure 3(c).    
        <br> 
        User <font style="color:#070;">DOT-StHimark</font> is the main organization which is respobsible for annoucing/updating information on roads and bridges in St. Himark. At 4 hours after the 3rd earthquake, Figure 3(d) shows important Y*INT messages regarding the activities (close/open) of Tranky Doo Bridge, Wilson Forest Highway, and 12th July Bridge (connecting outside to Safe town). 

        </div>

          <br><br>
         <b> 1.2. Power and Energy</b>
        <img id="power" src="images/power.png" class="full">
        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 4. Power and energy (<font style="color:#48c;">blue</font> stream) and the related posts/locations.</span></p>
        <div>
        For the entire time span, people constantly concern about Nuclear Plant and its efficiency as shown in the <font style="color:#48c;">blue</font> stream of Figure 4. The need of power significantly increase at 6 hours after 2nd earthquake and keep fluctuating 26 hours after. The possible regions in need of power include Cheddarford, Southwest, Scenic Vista, PalaceHill, and DownTown as shown by to connecting acrs at various hours. The links between Power/energy and roads/bridges are due to the spams detailed in Figure 4(b) as we mouse-over the arcs.

    <div class="pageContent">
        <b>1.3. Sewer and Water</b>
        <img id="sewer" src="images/sewer.png" class="full">
        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 5. Sewer and water concerns in our TimeAcrs visualization and related posts below.</span></p>
        <div>

        We now investigate sewer problems across St. Himark, by filteing only the posts that contain: sewage, discharge, drain, irrigation. We annotate the critical sewer events directly on Figiure 5(A) and list the detail messages in that hour at the bottom. Figiure 5(b) display the dicussions on broken sewer pipe in Old Town and other regions (Safe Town, Scenic Vista, Broadview, Chapparal and Easton) at 5 hours after earthquake as reported by <font style="color:#080;">HealthDept</font>. This leads to contaminated water: we can easily notice a peak on <font style="color:#48c;">water</font> stream at the same time. 
        <br><br>
        At 10 hours after the 2nd earthquake, the sewer problem becomes worst and leads to <b>flooding</b> mainly in Old Town as shown Figiure 5(c). We recommend the sewer crew to be assigned in Safe town and nearby to mitigate earthquake effects. <br><br>

        At 24 hours after the 2nd earthquake shown Figiure 5(d), the sewer problem has not been fixed. Temporal solution was proposed: drink boiled water and use portable toilet. When the 3rd earthquake hits, the sewer problem is not significant since the sewer system has not been repared (can not be worse) and the city is better prepared for the 3rd hit (volunteers were deployed to provide food, water, and blankets to citizens before the 3rd earthquake).

        <b>1.4. Medical and shelter</b>
        <img id="medical" src="images/medical.png" class="full">
        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 6. Medical and shelter issues in our TimeAcrs visualization and related posts below.</span></p>
        <div>
            We filter medical and shelter discussions by using the search box. As depicted in Figure 6(A), the demand for medical is very high immediately after the 2nd Earthquake and during 5 to 15 hours after that. Some medical-related reports are presented in Figure 6(b). In term of location, the rescure teams are needed in the regions near the earthquake center, such as
            Old Town, Safe town, Scenic Vista, and DownTown. <br><br>
            Additionally, the medical needs linked to the shelter demand from 6 hours to 15 hours after Earthquake with a slight delay of less than 1 hour. By mousing over a link, Figure 6(c) displays some medical vs. shelter demand at 15 hours after the 2nd earthquake.<br><br>
        At 24 hours after the 2nd earthquake shown Figiure 6(d), most of discussions are about evacuation as some of the main roads have been re-opened.

        <h4>Question</h4>

        <div class="question">2- Identify at least 3 times when conditions change in a way that warrants a re-allocation of city resources. What were the conditions before and after the inflection point? What locations were affected? Which resources are involved? Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.</div>

<page size="A3">
    <div class="pageContent">
        <div>Figure 7 illustrates 5 time points that St. Himark conditions have been change, from left to right: (a) 9:00am Wed 08, (b) 1:00pm Web 08, (c) 6:00pm Web 08, (d) 7:00pm Thu 09. The focused resourses are listed top-down. In particular, 

        <ul>
            <li> At <b>(a)</b>, all routes have been closed as announced by <font style="color:#070;">DOT-StHimark</font> , and no resource is needed at this point except some emergency medical issues. </li>
            <li>At <b>(b)</b>, the water (the 3rd resource in Figure 7) is contaminated due to broken pipe in Old Town, Safe Town, Scenic Vista, and Downtown. Moreover, the people start to call for help from Scenic Vista. Two routes have been open at this time. After that, the shelter, medical, and power remain high in almost all regions of St. Himark.</li>
            <li>When flooding happens at <b>(c)</b> (sewer and flooding connection at 10 hours after the 2nd earthquake), the shelter demand reaches the peak. Consequently, the medical demand increases after 2 hours in Palace Hills, Northwest, Downtown, Weston, and Southton. </li>
            <li>Then, all demand (except power) decreases until other bridges are re-opened at <b>(d)</b> to reduce the traffic jam at Magritte Bridge. </li>
            <li>After <b>(d)</b> (23 hours after the 2nd earthquake, people need food, water (links between food and water); some reports concerning roads and bridges problems in  Oak Willow and medical issues in Northwest, Southwest, Northwest, and Downtown.</li> 
            <li>Since all route re-open at <b>(e)</b>, no further resources are needed.</li>

        <h4>Question</h4>

        <div class="question">3- Take the pulse of the community. How has the earthquake affect life in St. Himark? What is the community experiencing outside the realm of the first two questions? Show decision makers summary information and relevant/characteristic examples. Limit your response to 800 words and 8 images.</div>
        <br>

        <img id="food" src="images/food.png" class="full">
        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 8. Demand of food .</span></p>
        <div>Besides resources in question 2 and 3, citizen also care about food (Figure 8) and water (Figure 9). According to figure 8, food isn't a big issue, yet some place such as Oak Willow the food problem come from traffic delay and the closed route showed in message Figure 8 (b).
            At 21 hours after 3rd earthquake, the high peak of food is not the demand but the discussion about food Figure 8 (c).</div>
        <div>Figure 9 shows the water stream and the connection. Due to the problem with sewer, 5 hours after 2nd earthquake, the water need to be boiled in order to drink and citizen very worry about that ( messages in Figure 9 (b) ). In the next 5 hours, the flooding happens. However, after 13 hours, water is not the problem.</div>
        <div>The fire event is displayed in Figure 10. Overall, a very limit post related to fire and fire department. However, about 5 hours (Figure 10 (c) )to 9hours after 2nd earthquake (Figure 10 (d)),  there are several messages report fire/ smoke/ burning issue in Old Town, Downtown, Scenic Vista, Southwest and Terrapin Springs. Since the power went off and everybody using candles as replace a light resource, a warning about candle and fire has been posted at 17 hours after the 2nd earthquake.</div>

        <h4>Question</h4>

        <div class="question">4- The data for this challenge can be analyzed either as a static collection or as a dynamic stream of data, as it would occur in a real emergency. Describe how you analyzed the data - as a static collection or a stream. How do you think this choice affected your analysis? Limit your response to 200 words and 3 images.</div> <br>
        <div>The text data in this visualization is inputted as an array of messages and processed directly within web browser using javascripts and <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>. In the real scenarios where the incoming data is large and dynamic, it is better to deploy a web server which performs data pre-processing and then sends the extracted terms/topics to the client (web browsers) via web api. The performance of this method can be improved using server rather than using client browser alone. <br><br>


        Whether using server or not, our web application still have ability to analyze both static and dynamic data. As the new streaming data coming, the new chunk of data is accumulated by the hour. An obvious limitation of our technique is that if the emerging topics or connections might not be highlighted until accumulated to a certain threshold, such as the link strength filter which sets the minimum coocurrences of two terms/events.<br><br>

        In this case, the aggregated time interval can be refined to 10 minutes or a minute to capture the hot topics/events and their associations in a timely manner. </div>
