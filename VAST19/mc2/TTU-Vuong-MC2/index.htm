        <p class="caption"><span>Figure 2. Examples of circular chart design for hourly summary of 3 mobile sensors: mobile sensor 10, mobile sensor 21, and mobile sensor 45.</span></p>

        <div> Due to the large number of sensor readings, we revise the Rosemary chart to embed the transformed color scale directly into the inside area of the pies. Our customized chart adopts the box plot layout which shows the five-number summary: minimum (inner ring), first quartile (Q1), mean (dashed curve), third quartile (Q3), and maximum (outer ring). This allows users to quickly spot the ranges of sensor readings as depicted in Figure 2. The examples in the report will show the hourly summary (from left to right) of various sensors (top-down) of St. Himark</div>

        <h4>Questions</h4>

        <div class="question">1- Visualize radiation measurements over time from both static and mobile sensors to identify areas where radiation over background is detected. Characterize changes over time.</div>

        <img id="radarChart" src="images/f_1_1.png" class="full">
         <p class="caption"><span>Figure 3. Overview of all regions, both dynamic and static sensors for the entire time span.</span></p>

         <div> Figure 3 shows the overview of St. Himark for the entire time span (5 days). Regions are listed top-down. The last row summarizes all sensors by hour. We can easily notice the high sensor readings connected to the earthquakes. <br><br></div>

        <img id="radarChart" src="images/f_1_2.png" class="full">
         <p class="caption"><span>Figure 4. Sensor readings for Wilson Forest.</span></p> 
         When users mouse over a region on the map, all sensor readings for that region will be highlighted in the main view. Figure 4 is an example when Wilson Forest is selected.

         <p class="caption"><span>Figure 5. Sensor readings for Old Town.</span></p> 

         <div> Figure 5 is an example when Old Town is selected. The arrow points to 4pm on Wed 08 with the high readings of the dynamic sensor 10. <br><br></div>
    

        <div class="question">2 - Use visual analytics to represent and analyze uncertainty in the measurement of radiation across the city. <br>
a. Compare uncertainty of the static sensors to the mobile sensors. What anomalies can you see? Are there sensors that are too uncertain to trust?<br>
b. Which regions of the city have greater uncertainty of radiation measurement? Use visual analytics to explain your rationale.<br>
c. What effects do you see in the sensor readings after the earthquake and other major events? What effect do these events have on uncertainty?<br>
        </div>

        <img id="radarChart" src="images/f_2_1.png" class="full">
         <p class="caption"><span>Figure 6. Overview of all sensors by every hour.</span></p> 
        <div> To show the uncertainty in the data, we refine the Rosemary chart to show min vs max (at the bottom) and Q1 vs. Q3 (on the top). As shown in Figure 6, 50 dynamic sensors are listed on the top and statics and 8 static sensors are listed at the bottom, the thumnails next to the sensor ids summarize the sensor reading over the entire time span. The larger bands indicate higher variance in the sensors reading over the given period of time. The static sensors tend to be more reliable than the dynamic sensors by looking at the thumbnails or the time series charts. A group of high values and high variances sensors are highlighted in the red box on the left.<br><br>

         <p class="caption"><span>Figure 7. Details view of Dynamic sensor 3.</span></p> 
        <div> By investigating of the such sensors, we found out that the dynamic sensor 3 is not reliable as it oftenly has fuctuated readings as show in the line graph within the popup window. The trajectory of the car is also printed on the St. Himark map.<br><br>     

            As also shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, Wilson Forest and Old Town have high sensor readings and high variance from 3pm to 9pm on Wed 08 and from 6pm of Thu 09 to 6am on Fri 10 respectively. These are also the time periods of 2nd and the 3rd earthquakes occured to St. Himark. Therefore, earthquakes may have the negative impacts on the radiation levels. <br><br>

     <div class="pageContent">
        <div class="question">3 - Given the uncertainty you observed in question 2, are the radiation measurements reliable enough to locate areas of concern?<br>
a. Highlight potential locations of contamination, including the locations of contaminated cars. Should St. Himark officials be worried about contaminated cars moving around the city?<br>
b. Estimate how many cars may have been contaminated when coolant leaked from the Always Safe plant. Use visual analysis of radiation measurements to determine if any have left the area.<br>
c. Indicated where you would deploy more sensors to improve radiation monitoring in the city. Would you recommend more static sensors or more mobile sensors or both? Use your visualization of radiation measurement uncertainty to justify your recommendation.<br> </div>

        <div> Figure 8 shows the deatils of 8 sensors with with high readings on Fri 10. Here are some observations: <br>
                    - They all have similar routes at the end: passing through Scenic Vista and then Wilson Forest. <br>
                    - Sensor 45 originated from Safe Town, close to the Always Safe plant, and may carried some radiation from there. Sensor 45 might be attached to the contaminated car. <br>

        <div class="question">4 - Summarize the state of radiation measurements at the end of the available period. Use your novel visualizations and analysis approaches to suggest a course of action for the city. Use visual analytics to compare the static sensor network to the mobile sensor network. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach? How do they support each other? <br> </div>

         <div class="question">5 - The data for this challenge can be analyzed either as a static collection or as a dynamic stream of data, as it would occur in a real emergency. Describe how you analyzed the data - as a static collection or a stream. How do you think this choice affected your analysis?  <br> </div>
